<p class="drop-capi-t">This text-book is designed for elementary college classes,
having already proved successful as a basis of Freshman
instruction in Indiana University. It gives a general
survey of mediaeval history from Charlemagne to the
close of the fifteenth century. It economizes time without
sacrificing anything of real importance. The facts to be taught
have been selected with great care. The continuity of the history
has been preserved from beginning to end, and the fundamental
features of mediaeval life and institutions are clearly brought out.
The book affords a clear, scholarly, compact outline, which can be
filled in in various ways. At the end of each chapter are suggestive
topics and search topics, and numerous specific references to the
best books for collateral reading. The aim of the book is to be
accurate in substance and definite in statement, to seize the vital
and interesting facts, and as far as possible to give that concreteness
of treatment which is necessary in dealing with matters so remote
and alien as those which fill the history of the Middle Ages.</p>

In Harvard College</h2>


<p class="authorheader">BY PROFESSOR CHARLES H. HASKINS.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most difficult question which
now confronts the college teacher of history
is the work of the first year of the college
course. The problem is comparatively new,
and becomes each year more serious.
Twenty-five or thirty years ago the small
amount of history taught in American colleges
came in the junior or senior year,
and was not organized into any regular
curriculum. With the recent development
of historical courses, however, the teaching
of history has worked down into the sophomore
and often into the freshman year,
so that the teacher of the first course in
history is not only charged with introducing
students to college work in history, but
must also take his share of the task of
introducing them to college work in general.
At the same time the enlargement
of the curriculum and the improvement of
instruction in history in many of our secondary
schools result in sending to the colleges
a body of students who have already
some familiarity with history and cannot
be treated in the same way as the great
mass of freshmen. Moreover, the first college
course in history in all our larger institutions
attracts a considerable number of
students, in some cases as many as four
hundred, so that the management of a
large class adds another element to the
problem; and matters are further complicated
by the fact that while some of these
will continue their historical studies in
later years, others must get from this
course all the historical training which they
will receive in college. I take it that no
one pretends to have found the solution
of these difficulties, and that what is at
present likely to prove helpful is not dogmatic
discussion so much as a comparison
of the experience of different institutions.</p>

<p>The introductory course at Harvard,
History 1, is designed to be useful to those
whose historical studies are to stop at this
point, as well as to serve as a basis for
further study. A period of the world’s history
is chosen which is sufficiently large to
give an idea of the growth of institutions
and the nature of historical evolution, yet
not so extensive as to render impossible an
acquaintance at close range with some of
the characteristic personalities and conditions
of the age; and an effort is made to
stimulate interest in history and to give
some idea of the nature and purposes of
historical study. The field covered is the
history of Europe, including England, from
the fourth to the fifteenth centuries. This
period has generally received little or no
attention in school, so that students come
to it with a freshness which they could not
bring to ancient history or American history,
and are introduced to a new world
of action and movement and color which
easily rouses their interest. The year devoted
to the Middle Ages bridges the gap
between their ancient and modern studies,
and not only gives a feeling of historical
continuity, but by showing the remote
origin of modern institutions and culture
it deepens the sense of indebtedness to the
past and furnishes something of the background
so much needed in our American life.</p>

<p>Most introductory courses now give considerable
attention to the Middle Ages; the
point of difference is whether the attempt
should be made to cover something of the
modern period as well. Where a longer
period has been chosen, it has been quite
generally found impracticable in a single
year to bring the course down to the
present time, and such courses have ordinarily
stopped somewhere in the eighteenth
century, leaving to a subsequent year the
study of the more recent period. Thus the
course which was given at Harvard until
1903 stopped at the Treaty of Utrecht.
Assuming that two years are necessary for
the satisfactory treatment of mediæval
and modern history for the purposes of
the general student, the question then becomes
one as to the point where the break
shall come, and we believe that experience
is in favor of placing this point fairly
early. The pace should be slower in the
first year than in the second, so that students
may not be confused and hurried
while they are learning new methods of
work and being emancipated from habits of
close dependence on the text-book. There
should be time for reading and assimilation,
as well as for thorough drill, in a way that
is not possible when too much ground is
gone over. Good training in the first year
makes it easier to cover a considerable
period in the second. Such at least has
been the experience at Harvard, where
about half of the students in History 1 go
on to the survey of modern history given
in History 2 in the following year, while
most of the others go directly to modern
English history or American history. It
ought to be added that while about nine-tenths
of the class of three hundred who
elect History 1 are freshmen, students who
have given a good deal of attention to history
in school are permitted to go on immediately
to more advanced courses; and
for those who take only American history
in their later years, the introductory
course in government is accepted as sufficient
preparation.</p>

<p>The class meets three times a week, twice
in a body for lectures, and the third hour in
sections of about twenty. The lectures do
not attempt to give a narrative, but seek
to bind together the students’ reading, comment
upon it, clarify it, reënforce the significant
points, and discuss special aspects
of the subject. The processes of historical
interpretation and criticism are illustrated
by a few simple examples, and from time
to time the work is vivified by the use of
lantern slides. The reading is divided into
two parts, prescribed and collateral, and indicated
on a printed “List of References”
which each member of the class is required
to buy. The prescribed reading, from seventy-five
to one hundred pages a week, is
made, as far as possible, the central part
of the student’s work. At first this is
selected largely from text-books and illustrative
sources; later in the year text-books
drop into the background, and narrative
and descriptive works are taken up,
although the student is urged to have at
hand a manual for consultation and for securing
a connected view of events. The
effort is made to break away from high
school methods of study and to teach students
to use intelligently larger historical
books. Stubb’s “Early Plantagenets,”
Jessopp’s “Coming of the Friars,” Bryce’s
“Holy Roman Empire,” Brown’s “Venetian
Republic,” Day’s “History of Commerce,”
Reinach’s “Apollo,” and Robinson and
Rolfe’s “Petrarch,” are examples of the
kind of books from which the required reading
is chosen. Some sources are given in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
their entirety, such as the “Germania,” the
“Life of St. Columban,” and Einhard’s
“Charlemagne”; but reliance is placed
mainly upon the extracts given in Ogg’s
“Source Book” and Robinson’s “Readings.”
It is found that the proper use and appreciation
of sources is one of the hardest
things for beginners to learn, and careful
and explicit teaching is required both at the
lectures and at the meetings of the sections.
Each student is required to provide
himself with two or three texts, a
source book, and an historical atlas, and
many buy a number of the other books
used in the course. The books in which
the reading is assigned are kept in a special
reading-room, where the supply is sufficient
to provide one copy of each for every
ten men in the course. Duplicates of the
works recommended for collateral reading
are also furnished.</p>

<p>At the weekly section meetings the students
are held responsible for the required
reading and the lectures for the week.
There is always a short written paper
about twenty minutes in length, including
usually an exercise on the outline map, and
the rest of the hour is spent in explanation,
review and discussion. No attempt is made
at systematic quizzing, as the work of the
week is much more effectively tested by the
written paper. These sections are held by
the assistants, four in number, who are
chosen from men who have had two or
three years of graduate study and generally
some experience in teaching.</p>

<p>For the collateral reading certain topics
are suggested each week, and every month
each member of the class is required to read
the references under at least one of the
assigned topics. These topics have considerable
range, and students are encouraged
to select those which have special interest
for them and to read freely upon
them. Thus if a student takes the Northmen
as his topic, he will read the greater
part of Keary’s “Vikings,” and translated
extracts from Norse poetry or sagas; if he
chooses Henry II, he will have Mrs. Green’s
biography and Stubb’s characterization in
the introduction to Benedict of Peterborough;
if he reads on monasticism, he will
compare different views of the subject as
found in specified chapters of Montalembert,
Lecky, Taylor’s “Classical Heritage of
the Middle Ages,” and in Harnack’s
“Monasticism”; on castles and castle life
he will read portions of Miss Bateson’s
“Mediæval England,” and Viollet-le-Duc’s
“Annals of a Fortress,” and examine the
illustrations in Enlart’s “Manuel” and
Schultz’s “Höfisches Leben”; on St. Louis
he will have Joinville, certain pages of
Langlois, and William Stearns Davis’s novel,
“Falaise of the Blessed Voices.” A certain
fixed minimum of such reading is set for
each one in the course, and a higher minimum
for those who expect distinction, and
ambitious students will read from 1,500 to
2,000 pages in the course of the year.</p>

<p>The effort is constantly made to develop
individual aptitudes and stimulate the better
men. Every student has at least eight
individual conferences with the assistant
during the year. The conference is devoted
mainly to a discussion of the collateral
reading, but it also serves as an opportunity
for examining note books, talking over
difficulties, and in general for closer personal
acquaintance between assistant and
student. Sometimes small voluntary groups
of men have been formed which meet the
assistant weekly at his room for the reading
and discussion of short historical papers
written by students.</p>

<p>Considerable attention is given to well-reasoned
note-taking upon both lectures and
required reading, a matter respecting which
the freshman is at first likely to be quite
helpless. Here the personal supervision of
the assistant is of the greatest value, and
is often exercised weekly.</p>

<p>Special emphasis is put upon historical
geography, not only by constant reference
to wall maps and by special exercises involving
the use of the principal historical
atlases, but also by means of the regular
use of blank outline maps. Members of the
class are required to bring such a map to
all meetings of the sections, and to be able
to locate upon it important places and
boundaries. The mid-year and final examinations
also include a regular test of such
geographical knowledge. More time than
should be necessary is devoted to this
work, but experience has shown that college
students have at the outset only the
vaguest ideas of European geography, and
in this and in some other respects it is
necessary to do in college, work that ought
to have been done in the secondary or
grammar school. If the ordinary freshman
brought with him an elementary knowledge
of geography and the ability to read intelligently,
the task of the college teacher of
history would be greatly lightened.</p>

<p>No attempt is made to require theses or
formal written reports, as such work is
useful rather for those who are to continue
their historical studies, and as regular
training of this sort is given in the
second-year courses. Some attempts have,
however, been made to coördinate the student’s
work in history and in English composition
by having the results of reading
upon an historical topic embodied in a brief
essay which is read and graded both by the
instructor in history and the instructor in
English. Such coöperative efforts are still
in the experimental stage, but they are regarded
favorably by those who believe that
the occasion for writing good English is not
confined to courses in English composition,
and that a broader policy with regard to
the student’s work is necessary if the
American college is to give an education
as well as to teach particular subjects.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_96">Impressions of American History Teaching<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></h2>

<p class="authorheader">EXTRACTS FROM MISS BURSTALL’S RECENT WORK, “IMPRESSIONS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION.”</p>


<p>Miss Sara A. Burstall, head mistress of
the Manchester (England) High School for
Girls, traveled in the United States during
the year 1908, studying and inspecting
American educational systems. Miss Burstall
has written out her experiences in
America in a book entitled “Impressions
of American Education in 1908.” The
author was particularly interested in the
teaching of history in American schools.
The following extracts are printed in the
belief that American teachers would desire
“to see themselves as others see them.”
In the chapter on “Method” occur the following
statements:</p>

<p>“Recitation is indeed an accurate description
of what one hears, sitting in an
American class-room; the pupil stands up
and recites what he has learnt, whether
from the standard text-book or from other
sources. The teacher may question some
statement in order to make sure that the
pupil understands what he has said, other
pupils will also question it. A girl will
put up her hand and (the teacher giving
permission by looking in her direction) will
say, ‘But I thought that I read in&mdash;&mdash;’
and will proceed to give some other view
of the subject. A general discussion will
follow which the teacher will not authoritatively
close by giving her correct opinion;
she will pass on to another part of the
subject and ask another pupil to recite what
he or she has learnt about it. If the reciter
makes an error the teacher will call
upon another pupil to correct it; very
rarely does the teacher make a correction
herself, and still more rarely does she express
her opinion. We were not struck by
the good English or excellence of oral composition
which we heard. The American
boys and girls did not do any better in this
respect than the English girls we know.
One can hardly expect fluent, elegant oral
descriptions and accounts except from practiced
speakers. With a class of thirty or
forty and a lesson period of forty-five minutes
obviously not all in the class recite;
quite half may take no share except as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
listeners. The presumption is that they
have learnt up their work, that they are
interested in listening to what others say
about it; their turn will come next day,
and in any case it is to their interest to
follow carefully what goes on.</p>

<p>“Three criticisms must occur to even a
sympathetic English teacher: first, the possibility
of what in England would be a
probable waste of time to the listeners.
Americans say that these, though they
often look indifferent and inattentive, are
really attending; they are used to the
method and they play the game, so to speak,
by listening attentively as well as by reciting
readily when their turn comes.
Second, the whole thing is very dull and
slow; each pupil speaks very slowly, with
very little grace of delivery or beauty of
language, such as might be expected from
the teacher, and nothing like the same
amount of ground is covered as is the case
in a lesson on the oral method. With the
recitation method in England we should
not arouse sufficient interest to get the best
out of our pupils; we could not get through
the work we have to do in the time, nor
would English boys and girls be sufficiently
quick and clever to understand the difficulties
in geometry, for example, or in Latin
or French grammar, unless they had clear
and skilful explanations from the teacher,
who presumably understands the art of
making things clear. Americans would
probably say that their students are quick
enough and earnest enough to make progress
without this careful exposition and
without this atmosphere of interest and intellectual
stimulus, and there is probably
some truth in the reply. Our pupils too
often do not want to work, and their minds
do move more slowly. We have been
obliged to find ways of making class-work
attractive, either by intellectual stimulus
and interest, or by rewards and punishments,
since we have not that strong outside
belief in education which makes the
task of the American teacher much more
easy. It is also true that the examination
demand has forced us to explain clearly to
the duller pupils in the class difficulties
which the cleverer ones could see through
for themselves. Probably here Americans
are right and we are wrong; we make the
work too easy by, as it were, peptonizing
the lesson material, before giving it to the
hungry sheep who look up to us to be fed.
Our aim has been to help them to assimilate
the knowledge required, not to develop
in them the power to grapple with new
material. This aim the American recitation
system undoubtedly develops, and this is
one of its great merits.</p>

<p>“Our third criticism is that the teacher
appears to do too little; her share in the
lesson is at a minimum; the new ideas do
not come from her, her influence is indirect.
Here, again, the American would say,
so much the better. The democratic ideal
is undoubtedly one cause for the existence
and the popularity of the recitation method.
The teacher and the pupils are very much
on a level. She is not teaching them; she
acts rather as chairman of the meeting,
the object of which is to ascertain whether
they have studied for themselves in a text-book,
and what they think about the material
they have been studying. Clearly,
then, the master is the text-book, and here
we strike on a vital peculiarity of American
education. Its aim has been intellectually
the mastery of books; with us education
has always been very much more,
always and everywhere, a personal relation.
The children learn from the master
or mistress with or without the aid of a
book.”</p>

<p>“The rise of the method can be explained
from historical causes; in the
old ungraded rural school of America, meeting
perhaps only for a few months in the
year, taught, it may be, by a woman in
the summer, and a man in the winter,
there could be no classification or organization.
Each pupil worked through an authorized
text-book, much as in the old Scottish
rural school, when a plowman might
come back for a couple of months to rub
up his arithmetic or English in the book
if he did not finish before leaving school.
The teacher went around and helped individual
pupils over difficulties, or heard
them ‘recite’ the lesson they had each
learnt, while the others went on with their
own tasks. Then when the schools came
to be graded, a number of pupils at about
the same stage could recite together out of
the book, and so the recitation method developed,
evolved by the American genius
for invention to fit the necessities of the
position. Among these conditions was the
absence of a body of experienced and skilled
teachers; much of the work was done by
all sorts of people, many with very scanty
qualifications, who would ‘teach school’
for a few months to earn enough to go on
with some other occupation. Such people
could not be in the true sense of the word
teachers; they could ‘conduct recitations’
and engage in the friendly questioning and
discussion as an equal, which the American
method implies. When first-rate, highly
qualified, skilled teachers come to play on
this instrument they bring forth from it a
wonderful result.</p>

<p>“The writer was fortunate enough to see
some very fine work by a woman teacher,
brilliant, systematized, full of interest and
fire, the pupils really taking part and bringing
their material which the teacher skillfully
percussed so that it kindled. Indeed,
the recitation method at its best and our
own oral method are almost identical in
effect; and far excel as educational instruments
anything that can be attained by
lectures. But how rarely is it seen at its
best? At its worst, of course, it becomes
mere memoriter repetition out of the text-book
with very little intelligence anywhere;
any teacher would do this who could keep
order.</p>

<p>“It is hoped that this imperfect sketch
may at least afford some idea of what is to
be seen in the United States by a teacher
of history, and of what we can learn from
them. Probably there is more to be learnt
in this subject by English students of
American education than in any other, and
the study is the more interesting and profitable
since the evolution of the present condition
of history teaching there is so recent.
The present writer can only say that she
has heard finer history teaching in more
than one American institution than she
ever heard in England, though her experiences
here have been fortunate, and that
such teaching has set for her an ideal
standard of professional skill in our difficult
art. England might learn, too, from the
life and vigor of the subject in the common
schools, the breadth and thoughtfulness and
the self-reliance in the history classes of
secondary schools, and the volume and
power of the historical work in the colleges
and technological institutes.</p>

<p>“The equipment is well worth our imitation
if only we could get the money for it.
Every good high school has a room or rooms
for the history lessons; cases of maps to
be drawn down when required&mdash;a product of
the American skill in mechanical appliances&mdash;are
universal, and an average high school
has a better supply of these maps than
some of our colleges. Pictures of every
sort abound.</p>

<p>“It is the opinion of one of the leading
American authorities on the teaching of
history, herself a distinguished teacher, that
there is a very real increase of intellectual
interest; some of it may be superficial, but
it is at least widespread. A nidus has been
formed and there is a real advance in the
subject.</p>

<p>“In England we have, as things are, the
tradition of public service and the inner instinct
of patriotism; formal teaching of
civic duty is not so much needed among the
wealthier and more cultivated classes,
though more ought to be done than is done
in the public elementary schools, and in
some of the new secondary schools. In
America this sociological teaching given in
connection with history is the one thing
they have to train citizens for citizenship;
religious instruction has been excluded
from their school system, personal influence
and corporate life play but little part compared
with the powerful one they play here.
There is no universal military service as in
Germany and France to teach by hard experience
the duty and the need of patriotism;
the tradition of unpaid public work so
strong in England is not known in the
United States. The teaching of history and
of patriotism through history is the one
force which America has in her schools and
colleges to stimulate and train the sense
of civic duty. One cannot but conclude that
to a half-conscious conviction of this truth
is due the system, the earnestness, the
concentration, and the excellence that
America achieves in the teaching of history
throughout every grade of her education.”</p>

<h2 id="Ref_99">Municipal Civics in Elementary and High Schools<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h2>


<p class="authorheader">BY JAMES J. SHEPPARD, PRINCIPAL OF HIGH SCHOOL OF COMMERCE, NEW YORK CITY.</p>

<p>In an address at the dedication of an educational building at
Albany a few days ago, Governor Hughes said: “I want to refer
to the importance in this day of giving our teachers and of having
them communicate to their pupils the proper sense of the responsibility
of citizenship in this country. It is not enough to have
patriotic songs sung. It is a fine thing to have the flag flying
and to have it continuously before the youthful mind as a symbol
of this great independent nation, of the land of the free and the
home of the brave. But as a distinguished man once said, it is a
very doubtful advantage to generate emotion which has no practical
use, and the emotions of patriotism ought to be stimulated
with regard to certain important and practical ends. Study of
civics, the knowledge of the actual operation of our government
is most important.”</p>

<p>In this statement the governor puts the case admirably. Civics
should be taught in the schools, and it should be taught in a
practical way. When your committee made its investigations
some half dozen years ago into the matter of instruction in
municipal government in elementary and high schools, it discovered
two things: First, a lamentable lack of proper instruction in the
subject in the schools of the country, and second, an earnest
desire on the part of those in authority to remedy this lack.
Advice and assistance were asked for by many who replied to our
questionnaire. We were impressed with the importance of presenting
something definite and concrete in the way of recommendations.
It was easy enough of course to say that the subject
should be taught in both elementary and high schools, that it
should be so placed in the curriculum, as to reach all the pupils,
and that it should be, as Governor Hughes puts it, a study of the
actual operations of our government. But the schools wanted
something more directly helpful than this. Few, if any, text-books
suitable for the purpose were available. Practically all of
them were written along the conventional lines of a scientific
treatment of the framework of government with but slight and
ineffective attempts to make the study other than one of broad
generalizations of little direct and concrete meaning to the youthful
student. Happily there has been some endeavor since the
committee’s first report to make texts which really meet the need,
and there are now on the market a few books which are genuinely
helpful. There is every reason to believe that the production of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
this class of books is greatly to increase. However the committee
believes that suitable texts can only help to solve the problem.</p>

<p>Governor Hughes is quite right in emphasizing “the importance
of giving our teachers and of having them communicate to their
pupils the proper sense of responsibility of citizenship in this
country.” That sense of responsibility will hardly be strong and
effective if it is to come from purely academic study of government.
It will be powerful and helpful if it comes from an earnest
and sympathetic study of government in operation, a study of
what the government is actually doing for the student, what it
ought to do and what he himself can do to improve it. A study
of this kind can hardly fail to give the future citizen a feeling
of pride in his own city, and a proper sense of his own responsibility
in making its government honest and efficient. The
municipal campaign recently concluded in New York seems to
have been conducted largely on the idea that the average voter
is more interested in personalities than policies. Such a campaign
would be impossible before an electorate having even an
elementary appreciation of the direct bearing upon its own personal
interests of an honest and efficient administration of the
city’s affairs. It is plainly the business of the schools to use their
extraordinary opportunity and extraordinary power to equip the
voters of to-morrow with a training in these vital affairs of government
that shall make them intelligent critics of what their
servants in office have done or what claimants for their ballots
propose to do. Heretofore the schools have been generally content
to give instruction on matters of state and national government,
with but scantiest reference to municipal affairs, in spite of the
fact that municipal government is of most direct and vital importance
to the citizen, touching him in his daily life at every turn.
If the schools could only establish firmly in the minds of the
students just the one fact that party labels are of no importance
in municipal matters, that honest and efficient administrators
should be chosen regardless of party connection or endorsement that
alone would be a tremendous gain. We have been going on the
assumption that a knowledge of state and federal government will
furnish enough insight into matters of administration to guide
the voter in matters of municipal government. It would be far
better if the choice were necessary to rely upon a proper knowledge
and appreciation of municipal interests to guide the voter
in the broader fields of government. The choice is of course not
necessary. State and national government should still be studied,
but in a more rational way. Much the same method may well be
employed as in the study of municipal government.</p>

<p>As has already been stated, your committee believes that instruction
in municipal government should reach every pupil in the
schools. That means that it should not be delayed in the elementary
school till the last year of the course, or in the high
school until the senior year, as is still generally the rule. A large
percentage of elementary school pupils drop out before they have
completed even the seventh year of the course, and a still larger
percentage of high school enrollment is lost long before the graduation
stage. The committee believes that there should be continuous
instruction in civics during the last four years of the
elementary course, moving along in easy and progressive fashion
from a very simple study of municipal housekeeping to a fairly
comprehensive notion of the city’s government activities. The
course as outlined in the New York City program of studies for
elementary schools has some admirable features. The course in
its present form is due in no small measure to the work of your
committee under the original chairmanship of Superintendent
Maxwell. It provides in the fifth year for some study of the
duties of citizens and public officials, and also of civic institutions.
The study begins very logically with the most obvious form of
municipal activity, the school itself, and goes on to other departments,
such as charities, tenement house, and parks, in each
instance emphasizing what good citizenship involves in the pupil’s
relation to the department. In other words, the study is not
merely descriptive, it is personal as well. In the sixth year the
outline calls for instruction concerning the chief administrative
office of the city. In the seventh year and the first half of the
eighth year there is no definite provision for municipal civics,
the time being devoted to national government. In the last half
of the eighth year there is a return to the city government with
“increasing emphasis upon the duties and responsibilities of a citizen,
or as a member of a family, as pupil, as employer or employed,
as voter or as office-holder.” The course would be greatly
improved by making a study of the city’s municipal activities
continuous throughout the four years. At present there is a
break in the work from the end of the sixth year to the beginning
of the last half of the eighth year. The difficulty is of course that
of a crowded curriculum, but the very great importance of the
study ought to win for it a definite place in the curriculum even
at the expense of some other study.</p>

<p>Just how well the elementary course in municipal civics is
administered in New York City or in other cities where it is
prescribed it is impossible for the committee to say. A recent
writer in the “Survey” seems rather skeptical of the results
obtained in New York. From her own showing, however, I think
the situation is not so bad as she seems to imagine it. We who
teach know the difficulty of getting pupils to do themselves justice
in examinations or tests. They really know more than their
answers indicate. Patient, skillful, sympathetic questioning will
often reveal intelligence where only ignorance seemed to exist.
It would be a matter for surprise, however, if our civics teaching
was at present all that it ought to be. It is a new thing in the
curriculum. Both its content and its proper presentation must be
worked out by experiment. It can only be well handled by
teachers with a keen love for the subject, a genuine appreciation
of its value and some taste for first hand investigation. Supervisory
officers must give it cordial support and helpful direction.</p>

<p>For the immediate future we must look to the high schools, I
think, to show the most marked development in the study of
municipal activities. The conditions of teaching are more favorable
and the teaching force better qualified to meet the problem.
History and economics are both more generally taught and certainly
much better taught than they were a decade ago, and it
will not be difficult, I think, to interest instructors in these subjects
in the new field of municipal government. Of prime importance
is the place of the new study in the curriculum. The
general custom hitherto has been to postpone all teaching of
civics in secondary schools until the fourth year, when American
history is taken up. This is a serious error, as it means no
instruction whatever in the subject for the vast majority of high
school students, a relatively small proportion of whom complete
the full course. It should not be postponed till even the second
year, but should be taken up at once by the student upon
entrance into the high school as a serious and important study.
Confessedly pupils of 14 or 15 are not well prepared to receive
instruction in civics, as it is generally taught as a scientific study
of state and national government, with a historical background.
The latter may well continue to be a part of a well-rounded high
school course, modified only by the inclusion of much more work
on the municipal side and greatly improved by more rational
methods of teaching. But your committee earnestly insists upon
place being made in the very first year of the high school course
for this new work. At present there is only one high school in
New York which is doing this, but it is interesting to note that
no less than three committees are now at work in that city upon
plans for a program of study in this subject. And, moreover, two
of these committees have been appointed by bodies of a public
character who are asking and securing the cooperation of progressive
teachers in the task of bringing about the desired change.
It is a very reasonable hope that in a comparatively short time all
the high schools in the Greater New York will be giving the civics
instruction so urgently needed to all the boys and girls who enter
their doors. Once New York or any other important educational
center shows the way, we may confidently expect the movement
to spread rapidly. Judging from the numerous communications
the chairman of your committee has received there is already
widespread interest in the subject.</p>

<p>The time is therefore ripe, apparently, for us to offer definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
recommendations in the make-up of a proper course of study in the
new subject, whose value as a part of the curriculum will depend
chiefly upon the manner in which it is presented. On the whole,
it is fortunate that a text-book is hardly possible except as a supplementary
aid, for there is grave danger that a study of municipal
activities based upon a text-book would take too much of an
academic character and interfere with or minimize the first-hand
observation and investigation on the part of both pupil and teacher,
which are of primary importance in realizing the aims of the work.
However, there are some books with which the teacher should
familiarize himself, among them such works as Baker’s “Municipal
Engineering and Sanitation,” Eaton’s “The Government of Municipalities,”
Fairlie’s “Municipal Administration,” Wilcox’s “The
American City,” Zueblin’s “American Municipal Progress” and
Shaw’s excellent books. These are useful in a broad, general way.
The teacher should make copious use of the city charter and
reports of the various city departments, such as health, tenement
house, parks, schools, etc. The pupil’s chief reliance will be on the
city charter apart from the teacher’s instruction and his own
observation and investigation.</p>

<p>The course might well be outlined in the following general way:</p>

<p>I. A brief consideration of the way in which government in
general arises, with a discussion of the rise of a village and its
development into the city. The pupil will be led to note the
extension of the coöperative idea from its simple manifestation
in the primitive community to the comprehensive undertakings of
a modern metropolis. The relation of the city to the State will
be made clear in this discussion, and a proper understanding of
what a city charter is be given.</p>

<p>II. Following immediately upon this brief introductory study,
which will take on added meaning as the course progresses, should
come a study of what may properly be considered the central element
of city life&mdash;the street. Here we can appeal directly to the
pupil’s own experience and observation in a marked degree, and
we are sure of his interest when the work is related so closely to
his daily life. It is probably worth while to give a pretty full
outline of the topics to be taken up in a study of the city street.
The one which follows has been in successful use for several years
in the High School of Commerce in New York, and naturally covers
some points of slight importance in other cities.</p>

</div>

<p>In this connection it is both desirable and feasible for the pupils
to visit the more important departments and get some first-hand
impressions of their work. Our experience has been that the city
officials willingly and helpfully coöperate with the school. Not
only have they furnished us much valuable material, but they have
also facilitated the inspection of their departments, and have not
infrequently themselves given helpful talks to the boys.</p>

<p>IV. Following close upon the study of the departments comes
a consideration of the cost to the city. The pupil has noted the
extensive activities of the municipality and the important question
of how they are all paid for looms up before him. The budget
must be studied, and the manner of levying and collecting taxes
must be understood, as well as the raising of money by loans.
Under proper guidance he will come to realize how extravagant
and inefficient government affects him personally, how honest and
economic government has a money value to every citizen. He will
want to know what city officers determine the amount of money
to be spent, and just what officers spend the money. New York
City has had a Board of Estimate and Apportionment in control
of its finances for a decade, yet it remained for the recent three-cornered
fight for the mayoralty, with its resulting choice of a
Democratic mayor and a Fusion Board of Estimate, to bring home
to the average citizen what the professional politician had long
understood, that this Board have really much more to do with the
government of the city than the mayor, that in reality New York
has a sort of government by commission.</p>

<p>V. We come finally in our study to a consideration of the citizen’s
part in the administration of municipal affairs. Topics such
as the following should be taken up:</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Becoming a citizen. Becoming a voter. Registration. Voting.
Voting but a part. The party organization. The cause of good
or bad government. How the citizen may govern the city through
the party organization. Enrollment. The district captain. The
district committee. The district leader. The general committee.
The leader of the organization. How the leader reaches his place.
Organization the key to success in politics. Candidates for office,
how selected, formally, actually. Why the high school graduate
should work through an organization for an honest, business-like
government.
</p>

<p>The preceding part of the course will have failed of its purpose
if it hasn’t established in the pupil’s mind certain elementary ideas
and ideals concerning the purpose of government and a sense of the
duty and responsibility which every citizen owes to the community
in which he works and lives. He will be an intelligent reader
of the numerous items in the daily press bearing upon the administration
of city affairs, and he will know how as a voter he may
take an active and effective part in that administration alike for
his own best interests and that of the community.</p>

<p>The course outlined is not an artificial affair based upon pure
theory. It has been successfully carried on in one high school for
half a decade, winning the enthusiastic interest of first-year pupils
as well as of the teachers charged with its conduct. It can be
adapted to the high school of any community, and will fail of its
purpose only if it is managed in a perfunctory fashion by instructors
who have not a professional interest in their work, or a high
sense of their great responsibility and their great opportunity.
It would be a splendid thing if we could require of all teachers
in the public schools a knowledge of the governmental activities
of the municipality they are called upon to serve, for surely they
of all citizens, ought to be familiar with the purpose and practice
of government.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_103">Has History a Practical Value?<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></h2>


<p class="authorheader">BY PROFESSOR J. N. BOWMAN, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY.</p>

<p>This question of the practical value of
history rises not out of a theory but out
of existing social and educational conditions.
In a practical age where “doing
things” receives such generous applause,
and “ends” are held in high estimation;
when “results,” and very frequently material
“results,” are the norms of success,
and “efficiency” widens its meaning beyond
the physical world,&mdash;then history, as well
as other subjects is called into question to
render an account of itself before the
judgment bar of the present. Life looms
up great beyond all the parts of the school
system. The eighth grade has its graduation
into life as well as the high school and
college. The grades feel their responsibility
to the great majority of their pupils
who go directly into life. In the East the
high schools are breaking from the “preparatory
status” to the college, and are
looking to the good they can do for their
pupils who get no more schooling. Trade
schools are growing up within and beside
the high schools, as the professional schools
grew up within and beside the colleges. The
college itself is in question by labor union
committees and inaugural addresses. The
university is becoming professional; even
Arts and Letters in preparing teachers and
general practitioners of arts and letters.
The industrial movement has now the economic
interpretation of history. The
“Market Reports”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of the university have
brought the “ticker” within the college
walls. Students and parents are asking
more and more insistently, “What is the
use?” and “What is the practical value?”</p>

<p>The question is not new; the questioners
are not new; the things questioned are
new. In olden days when schools existed
primarily for the Latin professions, the
question was answered: these things prepare
for law, medicine, and the ministry.
Schools now prepare for other professions
and also for the trades; but the question
is not yet answered without condition,
amendment or dissent. In those old days
the members of the Latin professions were
the bearers of the highest culture; but
now with our ideas of democracy and
opportunity, and the general diffusion of
knowledge, these members are but a small
fraction of the bearers of the highest culture.
The school system has grown from
the school of the professions into the school
of the people; but do the schools prepare
for the people as the older schools prepared
for the professions? A healthy,
growing institution&mdash;like Webster’s mariner&mdash;must
constantly take its bearings relative
to life to know how far the elements
of fads, specialization, and scholarly isolation
are driving it from its true course.</p>

<p>Practical relates to action, use, practice;
it refers to ends or means to ends; it is
opposed to theoretical, speculation or ideal.
But there is nothing in the word to debar
its use in mental as well as physical fields.
It may be used as the German uses
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">übung</i> in his university courses. Value is
the quality that makes something suitable
for ends or purposes. It permits the wildest
limit of “art for art’s sake”; and
equally permits one part of the “art” to
be suitable to the ends and purposes of
another part or of another “art.” Practical
value, then, is the quality that renders
a thing useful or desirable in meeting
ends. It does not by any means alone
imply “for revenue only.”</p>

<p>Has history a practical value? It depends
on the ends. The narrowest specialist
as well as the broadest humanitarian will
both agree upon the usefulness and desirability
of history to meet their respective
ends, but they disagree upon what the ends
are. The specialist is interested in history
for its own sake; to him the element of
history is the fact; the tradition of the
seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries has
forced him to select his facts in the fields
of politics, war and diplomacy; the method
he uses is rather a one-sided use of the
natural-scientific method. He is interested
in the facts for their own sake: he is
often too little interested in their value,
importance and inter-relations. He has
performed a great service in the nineteenth
century in correcting old facts and in finding
new ones. But now he has such mountains
of facts that he is overawed by their
mass, and long practice in his method prevents
him from using them. So a great
Harvard professor is reported as saying,
“Keep on piling up facts, their weight will
squeeze out some kind of order.” In his
attempt to be scientific the specialist has
used only one side of the scientist’s
method; he has forgotten that the scientist
works not only with matter, but with the
activities and relations of matter. He
loves to brush the mold off the dry bones
of the past. Perhaps he even has a dream
of articulating a few of the bones into a
cross section of the skeleton of the political
past. This is a rightful part of the work
in the university and graduate school, unfortunately
often the all-dominating part.
I have spoken at length of this work for
the reason that in this state there is required
of all high school teachers a year of
graduate work in some university of the
American Association. The specialist’s
method received there is all too often taken,
without adaptation into the high school and
occasionally even into the grades. So “art
for art’s sake” is perpetuated. The boy
is prepared for carrying on research when
he expects to carry on business, and the
girl is drilled in turning out monographs
when she expects to turn out biscuits.
Here is where the parents, and others, raise
the question, what is the use? The answer
and the reform must come from the top
downwards.</p>

<p>On the other hand the humanitarian is
often so broad that his work contains but
little of history; it is so thin and transparent
that it may justly be called culturine.
His pupils learn answers, but not
the steps to the answers; or they learn
the fashion phrase of the “example,” but
not the steps of solution. At every point
in their journey through the past they are
dependent on their Bædecker. Here again
is where the question is raised, what is the
use?</p>

<p>It is not necessary to make a choice of
either of these for the history work in the
schools. Where the fact-hunter ends his
work the historian may begin his. More
important than either fact or generalization
is the method of getting at each so that the
pupil may become self-active. If he learns
these methods he can use the facts in finding
other facts, in explaining and interpreting
other facts, or in understanding other
departments of life. He can use facts inductively
and through a process of analysis
and classification reach generalization; or
like Kepler, Newton and Faraday he can
work on the facts deductively. He can
follow lines of interest, threads of activity;
he can view them from one view point
or from different view points. On the other
hand he can learn and use the method of
working a fact after the Seignobosian
“rules of the game.” So even within the
narrower and professional field there is the
practical value.</p>

<p>But the end is still in question. The
pupil goes from the grades, high school and
college into life to take his part as a
workman some eight hours of the day and
as a citizen all twenty-four; as an active,
creative worker through the prime of his
life, and as a member of society to his
grave. The parents and the people out in
life ask the question of the practical value,
and they answer it from the standpoint of
life and social efficiency. Does history
stand the test?</p>

<p>From this point of view the specialist
fails; the storehouse of facts is static, efficiency
is active; the method of facts results
only in another static fact. The culturine
teacher fares somewhat better; he is active,
but unfortunately with empty symbols.
He deals with answers and not with problems,
with his Bædecker and not with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
thing itself. It is the long stretch between
the two that is wanting&mdash;the process, the
use. The history work must be adapted to
the life needs of the pupils as members of
society: those facts, those generalizations,
and especially those processes of reaching
from one to the other, that can make him
an efficient member of society. Isolated facts
will be soon forgotten, generalizations will
perhaps stick longer, but methods of generalization
can be used throughout life on
new facts to reach new generalizations.</p>

<p>What are some of the things in life and
society for which history may be used,&mdash;the
ends to which it may be adapted in
study and teaching? Someone has pointed
out four ends, but I should like to add
another, fully conscious of the excepting
and varying relations between them:
<em>reading</em>, <em>studying</em>, <em>teaching</em>, <em>writing</em>, and I
should like to add <em>living</em>. Writing is justly
the work of the professional, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i>, the
graduate school; yet if history ever becomes
a science it is not at all impossible that
living may not usurp this position in graduate
work. Teaching, in this state, is also
the work of the graduate school and the
last years of the college. This leaves, then,
reading, studying and living that touch the
history work from the grades to the college;
these also underlie the other two.</p>

<p>The basis on which all these rest is life
itself, and the interest one takes in life.
Since one is here in this world he is interested
in it, to get as much out of and put
as much into it as he can; if he has no
interest he at least exerts himself either
to be a parasite or to shuffle off its
weight. This interest is the starting point
of the interest in the past of this life;
the basis of the ascending scale from reading
onward.</p>

<p>Reading runs through all history work
from the stories&mdash;told and read&mdash;in the
grades to the reading after dinner by the
evening fireside. Interest in life as it was,
is, and is becoming: the problems and policies,
the activity and struggle, the peaceful
life of the cotter or the demon life of
the battlefield, the growth of trade and the
sailing of Columbus, or the work of Bach
or Paracelsus. From some life interest now
one travels back to chosen places and times,
and under the lead of some Virgil and Beatrice
does more than Dante in taking up
temporary habitation then and there.
From a purely commercial point of view,
also, the historian can here benefit himself&mdash;and
his publisher&mdash;in preparing a public
to demand his books.</p>

<p>Studying is a step beyond reading; Virgil
and Beatrice are here dismissed. It explores
some field of interest and follows some
thread; it reads pages and chapters and not
volumes or series. The books may be
stories, texts or documents&mdash;the story must
be pieced together from many sources. In
reading, the books lead the reader; in
studying, the student leads the books. It
is the transitory inquisitiveness of the
child become somewhat constant in the later
grades and high school, and fixed in the
university in the professional study of “ut
clauses.” Reflection and study go hand in
hand,&mdash;the latter to answer the questions
of the former. For the very great majority
of people this is the nearest they ever get
to professional history work. It is of the
greatest practical value to those who use
history for other than the pleasant hour’s
reading.</p>

<p>In living, life and history unite. This,
of course, touches the live question of what
is history. The specialist and his methods
are adaptable practically alone to a past
not coming within eighty to twenty years
of the present. But the parent and the man
in life deal on the one hand with human
beings, institutions, matter, etc., and on the
other with life forces and energies. All
these exist in different and modified forms
in the specialist’s past. If this breach
between the past and present cannot be
bridged, then the laboring man is right in
asking that history be displaced by things
that can bridge it. The man in life is busy
with the art of living&mdash;can history help him
in this? If history is ever to be a science
and be scientific, it must consider, as do
the sciences, the consequent question of
being an art&mdash;of reaching desired effects
with known causes.</p>

<p>Those who ask the question, has history
a practical value, go from the present life
into history. From that viewpoint they
see its workings, and from life and society
they draw their norm by which they judge
it, accept it in the curriculum and pay
taxes for the history teacher’s salary. For
such a purely selfish note as this history
should not wait; but should search out in
society and life how it may be of service
some way and somehow, and through its
teaching supply these needs. It can then
make itself indispensable and forestall all
question of its practical value.</p>

<p>The practical value of history to life
depends on a complex of race, age, country,
locality and the individual. Some phases
of this value might be stated thus: an
ease in observing, analyzing and classifying
the life activities of to-day. No other subject
taught in the schools touches life at so
many points and in so many of its activities.
Through seeing in history the close
interrelation of activities in the past the
student can be led to see the close interrelation
of the activities of his own day.
Again, he learns to see life as a historic
whole&mdash;his contemporaneous life in connection
with the life of the race. He thus
learns valuations and norms for judging
character. He learns that Jeffries and
Johnson are less valuable in life than Pasteur
and Eucken; that even in the history
of pugilism they perhaps are less noteworthy
than either Sullivan or Corbett.
Again, history can help him to save experience.
He can learn to apply with due
modification to present problems not the
answers of the past to past problems, but
the ways of solving those problems. Material
and social environments exist now as
they existed in the days of the Greeks;
hunger and socialization, love and ambition,
the desire to know and to feel, are as effective
now as in the days of Socrates. The
combination and the emphasis change. The
past cannot answer the problem of the
present, but can help him to answer it.
Again, history can help him to be tolerant,
since our day demands tolerance. In
studying some struggle of the past he
learns to see that question from two or
more sides; this practice helps, with the
practice in other subjects taught in the
schools, to consider a present question
from its many sides.</p>

<p>Historical impartiality is frequently misused:
impartiality plays its part in the
consideration of questions, but should not
be allowed to mar decisions when once
made. The specialist and his pupils can
easily stand off from and out of present,
active life like men from Mars. Tolerance,
then, is desirable in the consideration
of questions, and of the activities acknowledged
by society; for tolerance, like liberty,
does not mean license. Again, history
has a practical value in connecting the
present almost as intimately with the past
as hope does the present with the future.
It gives two or more points together with
the present from which direction and tendency
may be seen. It can thus help to
break down the loneliness of the present.</p>

<p>The life of each succeeding present must
dictate its own norms of efficiency:
whether citizenship or patriotism, character
or individuality, socialization or socialism,
etc. The practical value of history is like
the practical value of all other subjects&mdash;it
must adapt itself to life needs, and by
its leadership make itself indispensable to
life and society. Also it must be of practical
value to the individual for his pleasure,
his use, and his business; by its adaptability
to these ends it makes itself indispensable
to him. It has this practical value
for the pupils in the grades, high school,
and college, in contributing something for
themselves and for their parts in life.</p>

<p>An Idaho cow-puncher last summer defined
life as “just one d&mdash;&mdash; thing after
another.” It has also been pointed out
that this is the best definition of history,
as all too often taught and written. The
“cow-puncher” forms a small class, and
is rapidly disappearing; history will soon
be forced to adapt itself to another class
and to a life otherwise defined. In doing
so it is hoped that it will not be by this
chance and unconscious adaptation, but
that it will consciously and deliberately
adapt itself to the new class and its life.</p>

<p>I believe history has a practical value
in life, and a place in the school system;
and also that it can prove this value so
efficiently that its critics will not wish to
relegate history to the position of Greek
and Latin.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_105">“A Source History of the United States”</h2>


<p class="authorheader">BY PROFESSORS CALDWELL AND PERSINGER.</p>

<p>Many of the literary histories written in
the last half century have carefully
avoided quotations or reprints of documents.
In the early historical literature
of America documents were inserted or
appended to almost every history; but this
style gave way to the literary ideal of expressing
the thought of the documents in
the historian’s own words. There are
many volumed histories written toward the
close of the nineteenth century which make
no pretence of reproducing the form or
words of the source-material. It was but
natural, therefore, when the study of history
came to be taken up seriously in colleges
and schools, that teachers and scholars
should desire to get away from the insipid
literary generalizations, and taste the freshness
of the original sources. It was this
insistence upon a certain literary style
which created the source-book; and to-day
we have therefore the literary history and
the source-collection side by side. Early
source-books contained simply highly significant
documents, or documents which
might be treated as types. We have advanced
far from this, and now our editor
aims to give the narrative of history in
the language of the original documents.</p>

<p>Casting aside all reverence for the document
as a completed whole, Professors Caldwell
and Persinger have cut and trimmed
out every unnecessary phrase and sentence,
taking a few words from one document, a
few paragraphs from another, a few pages,
perhaps, from another. By this process, the
volume is made to approach nearly to the
consecutive development of thought and arrangement
shown in the narrative histories.
The language and spelling of the originals
are in all cases preserved, and all omissions
are indicated by the usual typographical
means.</p>

<p>The work is divided into four chapters;
the first on “The Making of Colonial
America,” occupies 165 pages; the second,
“Revolution and Independence, 1764-1786,”
fills 100 pages; the third, “The Making of
a Democratic Nation,” 131 pages; and the
fourth, “Slavery and the Sectional Struggle,
1841-1877,” 86 pages. Or, to put it in
other words, the period before 1789 is allotted
284 pages, while that under the
constitution to 1877 is given 200 pages.
Each chapter is subdivided into sections,
and these into smaller groups of sources.
Taking for granted that the plan of the
editors is a practical one, the test as to
whether they have done it well is to be
found in the proportions assigned to the
several topics, and in the character of the
extracts given or excluded. The first
thought which comes to mind is that too
much space has been given to the colonial
and revolutionary periods, and too little to
the constitutional period. An inspection of
the several sections shows that the colonial
period lends itself best to the form
of treatment adopted by the authors, and
naturally they have emphasized that period.
The documents upon recent history, particularly
the civil war and reconstruction,
have not fitted so readily into the narrative.
Yet it must be admitted that the
editors have resolutely carried on their
method to the close; they give extracts
from Lincoln’s public papers and letters respecting
slavery and reconstruction, and
arrange them in the same analytical form
adopted for the extracts bearing upon the
Stamp Act or on Bacon’s Rebellion. One
cannot but wish, however, that the editors
had been as generous in their excerpts
for the later period as they were for the
earlier; perhaps five pages of quotations is
not too much for the “Effects of the English
Revolution of 1688” upon America,
but surely two pages is too short for Lincoln’s
attitude toward slavery; we welcome
the ten pages of extracts from Washington’s
letters bearing upon the Revolutionary
War, but we wish for more than
two very short quotations treating of the
Civil War.</p>

<p>The method of the editors can best be
shown by noting the character of the illustrative
material gathered by them upon several
topics. For instance in Chapter I
there is the sub-topic, “Colonial Constitutional
Development, 1689-1763,” occupying
17 pages. Within this space we have quotations
from the ordinance of 1696 creating
the Board of Lords of Trade and Plantations,
and from the additional instructions
of 1752 respecting the board. There
are as many as fourteen extracts showing
the increased parliamentary regulation of
colonial affairs in the period 1696 to 1751.
These include parts of the navigation act of
1696, Edmund Burke’s account of the sugar
act of 1733, extracts from the woolens act
of 1699, the hat act of 1732, and the iron
act of 1750; excerpts showing the bounties
on naval stores, rice and indigo; and quotations
from the act regulating colonial coinage
(1707), the post-office act of 1710, the
debt recovery act of 1732, the naturalization
act of 1740, the land-bank act of 1741,
and the paper money act of 1751. Next
there are four quotations showing the desire
of the English authorities to reduce
all the colonies to one form of government;
and the same number of extracts from
plans for colonial union. Then follow three
extracts showing the desire to establish an
Anglican episcopate in the colonies, and
the section closes with papers illustrating
the “growing assertion of colonial rights.”
Under the latter heading we have four extracts
relating to conflicts between the
governors and the assemblies; an account
of the trial and acquittal of John Peter
Zenger; John Adams’ account of James
Otis’ speech against writs of assistance;
and a report of Patrick Henry’s speech in
the Parson’s Cause. Such an array of quotations
shows not only wide reading and
intensive knowledge of the documents, but
it also implies a keen judgment as to their
pedagogical value, and an ability to arrange
the extracts into a working analysis.</p>

<p>In such a work one would naturally look
for the treatment of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Culturgeschichte</i>, and
indeed the editors have not neglected this
side of their story. An interesting section
is that describing the industrial, social, and
religious condition of the country in 1840.
The subject is analyzed minutely,&mdash;like all
other parts of the work,&mdash;into such topics
as “business characteristics,” “means of
communication,” “the standard of living,”
“democracy,” “the South,” and “American
Morals.” The sources for quotation
are almost exclusively the accounts of
European&mdash;mainly English&mdash;travelers in the
country at the period. These accounts are
well known to students of the period, but it
has been difficult heretofore for teachers to
bring the flavor of these criticisms to the
scholars of high school or even college
classes. The editors of the “Source-history”
have selected and arranged a series
of accounts from Buckingham, Martineau,
Chambers, Dickens, Grund, Lyell, de Tocqueville
and others which will be of service
in both college and secondary school classes.</p>

<p>The two sections here mentioned show
the method of the editors. Not only have
they selected their material with skill, but
they have also arranged it under such a
scheme of topics that it may be used by
the tyro in the study of history. He does
not need to dig the historical jewels out
from the midst of documentary rubbish;
that has been done for him. In addition
the editors have placed extended series of
questions upon the text at the close of each
section, and references to the standard
text-books. There is an analytical table of
contents, but no index. There are some
typographical errors in the book which
should be corrected in a later edition. It
is also to be hoped if we are to have any
more of such collections, that a simpler
typographical device may be invented to
mark omitted matter.</p>

<p>The work is a valuable pedagogical device;
it marks the climax of the source-method.
It should very widely extend the
knowledge of sources in our high schools
and colleges. We shall watch its use with
interest.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_106">THE HISTORY TEACHER AND THE
COMMUNITY.</h2>


<p>The teacher of history in secondary
school or college has a better opportunity
to influence the community in which he
lives than the teacher of almost any other
subject; and if to history it be his or her
lot to add economics and government as
well, the field of influence should be correspondingly
widened. Mathematics, formal
English, exact science, the foreign languages,
one and all, must give way in human
interest to that of biography and history.
At the beck and call of the historian
there are all our records of what man has
thought and said and done. Shall the history
teacher leave those fields untouched?
Shall he keep his knowledge to himself
alone? Shall he limit himself to text-book
work in the class-room, and do nothing to
extend the interest in his subject throughout
the community? If this is his practice,
no wonder his subject is treated with disdain
by school directors, no wonder that he
cannot get a library of books upon his subject,
no wonder that he becomes an irresponsive
fossil.</p>

<p>In many ways the history teacher may
influence the community. He may advise
and co-operate with the local librarians in
the purchase and loan of books; he may
give public lectures upon historical topics;
he may write historical articles for papers
or for publication in book form; he may
found or join societies for the study of
local history; he may use means to keep
alive the local interest in history. These
activities will win respect for the teacher
and the subject, and develop in our American
communities a similar respect for local
history and tradition. Forthcoming numbers
of <span class="smcap">The History Teacher’s Magazine</span>
will discuss in detail certain of these activities,
such as the relation of the history
teacher to the public librarian, and to local
historical societies; for the present, mention
will be made simply of those miscellaneous
means the teacher may use to
keep alive interest in local history.</p>

<p>A receptive attitude with reference to
local tradition and history should always be
taken by the history teacher. He should
know something of the local history within
a few weeks after he has entered a new
community, if he has not been able to
study it in advance. A young graduate
student entering a small western college as
instructor, found in the library no volumes
upon the subject of his doctor’s thesis. He
did not wait for the summer vacation to
continue his studies in Europe, but started
at once to make certain local studies, which
were so successful that they gained for
him a national as well as a local reputation,
and stimulated others to a scientific
study of the State’s history. In a similar
way the instructor in any high school or
college should familiarize himself with local
history, and aim, if possible, to make some
definite contribution to its literature.</p>

<p>Another subject in which the history
teacher should be interested is that of local
names. The tendency of American legislators
is to obliterate local names, particularly
if they have not what is deemed a proper
connotation, and substitute for them the
names of petty politicians or, what is even
worse, some system of numerals. Compare,
for instance, the system of numbering public
schools in New York City with that of
naming them in use in some other cities;
or that of numbering all streets and avenues
and wards with the custom of keeping
the old historic names. Much of the sentiment
for us to-day would be taken from
London, or Paris, or even our own Boston,
if a numbering system, independent of local
traditions, had been adopted two hundred
years ago.</p>

<p>The proper marking of historic spots is a
matter of interest to any community, and
the history teacher should be a leader in
such an undertaking. Much is being done
in this direction by individuals and societies,
but much more needs to be done. In
awakening public interest, even by showing
the authorities that it is economically wise
to mark such spots for the encouragement
and convenience of visitors, the history
teacher will win respect from the community.</p>

<p>Historical pageants have been held in
parts of Europe for centuries, but recently
they have been revived upon a large scale,
and already America has seen several which
would rank high with those of Europe. The
pageants at Quebec, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia
in 1908, at Lake Champlain in 1909,
and the Hudson-Fulton celebration in New
York all furnish excellent opportunities for
education in historical facts and development.
Such lessons will grow in number
with increasing respect for the past, and
with the growing desire for meaning in
pageantry, rather than noise and sound in
parades. Here also the history teacher will
find wide opportunity for all his knowledge
and experience.</p>

<p>Surely it is the fault of the teacher and
not of history itself if the community
ignores him and his subject.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_107">American History in the Secondary School</h2>


<p class="authorheader">ARTHUR M. WOLFSON, PH.D., Editor.</p>

<p class="subtitleheader">FOUNDATIONS FOR THE STUDY OF
THE FOREIGN RELATIONS OF THE
UNITED STATES.</p>

<p>The ratification of the Constitution of
the United States marks the end of one
period of American history and the beginning
of another. At that point the teacher
should pause and gather up with his class
all the threads which he has thus far been
following. The problems henceforth to be
presented are those of a well-established,
entirely independent nation.</p>

<p>First of all, it should be noted that the
history of the nation during its one hundred
and twenty years of existence divides
itself into five more or less distinct periods.
These periods are (1) the thirty odd years
from 1789 to 1823, during which time the
nation was settling the foundations of its
political life, internal and external; (2) the
thirty years from 1820 to 1850, during
which the nation was moving forward,
under two diametrically opposed parties
(those in favor of the extension of slavery
and those opposed to its extension), in the
occupation of the vast tracts of land
beyond the Mississippi; (3) the twenty-five
or twenty-six years from 1850 to 1876, during
which these two parties finally came to
blows and settled the constitutional questions
involved in secession; (4) the twenty
odd years from 1876 to 1898, during which
the nation is forced to deal with new and
unaccustomed economic questions; (5) the
ten years or more since the Spanish-American
War, the period of present-day practical
politics.</p>

<p>Such an outline as this of the entire
course of American history may seem to
many teachers to be a little forehanded, yet
it is our firm conviction that only that
teacher who sees in the beginning the entire
work of the term can deal with each lesson
as it arises properly. Of this outline, even
the class should not be entirely ignorant.</p>

<p>As to the first period&mdash;the period of the
establishment of our national policy&mdash;in it
the class will be confronted by two more
or less distinct problems: first, the questions
of internal policy, the solution of which
can be found in the study of the activities
of Alexander Hamilton as Secretary of the
Treasury, and of his contemporaries. These
problems, important as they are, space requires
that we leave for the present for the
teacher himself to analyze and present to
his pupils. In passing, we may say, however,
that both teacher and pupils will find
themselves amply repaid by a careful study
of the reports of Hamilton and Jefferson
which are to be found in Macdonald’s
“Documents.”</p>

<p>Far more complex, and far more difficult,
are the problems which are presented
by the relations of the United States to its
foreign friends and enemies. The mere
study of the text-book, we have found,
leaves the pupils hopelessly confused and
bewildered. As the result of a number of
years of experience we have come to believe
that it pays, at the beginning, before
one attempts to say a word about Washington’s
Proclamation of Neutrality, about
the principles involved in the struggles with
France and England, about the treaties
with Spain and the purchase of Louisiana,
to devote at least one or two lessons to a
careful analysis of all the elements involved
in our relations with foreign nations. In
doing this we shall find that all questions
of foreign policy fall under one of four
headings: (1) commerce, (2) citizenship,
(3) territory, (4) the position which the
nation will take in case of disagreements
between two or more foreign nations. Any
class, skilfully led, will be able to furnish
the teacher with these four headings. Then
one may go on to further analysis. For
instance, the class will see at once that
commerce in times of peace and in times of
war must be conducted upon a different
basis. Under the first condition, commercial
relations are usually settled by commercial
treaties, though under special conditions
they may involve questions like the
right of the nation to trade with the colonies
of a foreign nation, and the question
of the “open door” of which we have heard
so much in the last two or three decades.
In times of war, the rights of neutral trade
are much more complicated. Here they involve,
especially in the earliest period of
United States history, at least four different
questions: (1) what constitutes an efficient
blockade, (2) what articles may
rightly be considered as contraband, (3)
how far do “free ships make free goods,”
(4) is trade with ports of one of the belligerents,
closed in times of peace, open to
the neutral in times of war (Rule of 1756)?
Each of these questions, we have found,
will offer opportunity for spirited class
room discussion. None of them is simple,
and the teacher should therefore be sure
that he has his own answers ready before
he attempts to open the discussion to the
class.</p>

<p>The question of citizenship is easier. To
begin with, we all agree that it is the duty
of the nation to protect its citizens against
unjust oppression. But not all nations at
the end of the eighteenth century, or even
to-day, are agreed as to what constitutes
citizenship. Does naturalization, for instance,
destroy the obligations which the
individual owed to the country of his original
allegiance? This is, of course, the single
vital question involved in the dispute
between the United States and England
over impressment, though there is a subsidiary
question, the right of entrance and
search in times of war which the teacher
should not neglect in presenting the subject.</p>

<p>The question of the acquisition of territory
is again comparatively easy of analysis.
All that it requires is for the teacher
to show to his class that it was the “manifest
destiny” of the nation to acquire, step
by step, all the land lying south and west
of the original limits of the country as far
west as the Pacific Ocean. Whether the
nation was wise in going beyond the confines
of the continent in the acquisition of
territory may be left till a later period for
discussion.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the question as to the
position which the United States should
take in cases of dispute between the European
nations. Here again the teacher
should be prepared to show that self-preservation
required that the United States
should assume a position of absolute neutrality,
that it was equally necessary, on
the other hand, at least in the early years
of the nineteenth century, that we demand
that the European nations refrain from interfering
in the affairs of America.</p>

<p>Coming now to the study of the specific
events which illustrate these principles, the
teacher will be ready to develop and the
class will be ready to appreciate the series
of events which begin with Washington’s
Proclamation of Neutrality, which are involved
in the disputes with England which
were settled temporarily by the Jay Treaty
and later by the War of 1812 and the
Treaty of Ghent. Next the negotiations
with Spain concerning the right of entry
and deposit at the mouth of the Mississippi
and the later negotiations with France concerning
the purchase of Louisiana may be
developed. Finally in this analysis the class
will find the key to that series of proclamations
and messages which begin with
Washington’s Farewell Address, which proceed
through the messages of Adams and
Jefferson, which end with Monroe’s message
of December, 1823, commonly known
as the Monroe Doctrine. When all this is
done, the well-equipped teacher will be
ready to discuss briefly with his class the
later diplomatic history of the country, the
gradual modification of the principles for
which Washington, Jefferson, John Quincy
Adams and Monroe contended, but he will
find to his surprise that until the very last
years of the nineteenth century little
change was made in the whole system.</p>

<p>In the study of this period the teacher is
earnestly recommended to have frequent
recourse with his class to the documents
which illustrate the history. Most of them
can be found in convenient form in MacDonald’s
“Documents,” in the “American History
Leaflets,” in the “Old South Leaflets,”
and in Hill’s “Liberty Documents,” a comparatively
recent publication. For further
reading, the teacher is recommended not
only to the standard histories of the United
States like Schouler’s, and McMaster’s, but
also to the exhaustive work of Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Adams, “History of the United States in
the Administrations of Jefferson and Madison.”
Finally, there are the three or four
diplomatic histories of the United States
of which the best are John B. Moore’s
“American Foreign Policy,” Hart’s
“Foundations of the American Foreign Policy”
and John W. Foster’s “A Century of
American Diplomacy.” In each of these
works the teacher will find a thorough
analysis of the Monroe Doctrine, its history
and its application; should he desire
to examine the Doctrine further, he will
find material in two special studies: George
F. Tucker’s “Monroe Doctrine,” and William
F. Reddaway’s “Monroe Doctrine.”
The first is an American presentation of the
subject; the second that of an Englishman.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_108">Ashley’s “American History”</h2>


<p class="authorheader">REVIEWED BY H. R. TUCKER, McKINLEY HIGH SCHOOL, ST. LOUIS, MO.</p>

<p>Mr. Ashley has added another excellent
text on American history to the numerous
recent ones for secondary schools. The
course of events is carried down to 1907.
“The subjects have been grouped under
topical heads. The author has hoped to
indicate by this means the relation of each
historical change to the movement of the
times and the relation of this smaller movement
to the larger phases of our development
which are given in the chapters”
(preface). The attention given to wars is
agreeably less than in texts of some years
ago,&mdash;only 100 pages out of 550. Industrial
and social development, and economic
phases are given 100 pages. These chapters
are after the various epochal periods;
they are complete and attractive. Over 100
pages are given to the period since the Civil
War. All these proportions are in agreement
with the general trend in historical
instruction to-day. The relation of governmental
institutions to historical development
is especially clear.</p>

<p>The opening chapter is on geographic influences
of America and the early European
background. Such sections in the book as
follows are illustrative of the clearness of
topics usually difficult for high school pupils:&mdash;40,
“English Puritans”; 87, “English
Colonists and Their Governors,” where
the temperament of governor is considered
an important factor; 265, distinction between
Jeffersonian and Jacksonian democracy;
330, “Fundamental causes of Secession”;
331, “Slavery and state sovereignty
vs. nationality”; 337-345, “Conditions
affecting Union Success.” It is a
pleasure to note the comparative brief description
of such complicated military or
naval movements as the naval episodes of
the War of 1812, the Shenandoah Valley
campaign of the Civil War (1864), the
Vicksburg campaign, &amp;c. The author is
quite fair in that period in which every
American historian is most open to the
charge of being prejudiced,&mdash;the Civil War.
He shows an impartial attitude; he gives
credit to both sides. The account is written
in true historical perspective without
discrediting the value of the final result.
The bearing of lines of communication upon
the course of wars are indicated. Many
will appreciate the omission of the names
of the assassins of the martyred President,
probably the first school text to do this.</p>

<p>There are a few defects: It is not evident
from the account of the Battle of Bunker
Hill why it was called such, though
fought on Breed’s Hill. Certainly J. Q.
Adams’ name should be given in connection
with the “gag resolution” of 1835. The
sections of the copy of the national constitution
should be subdivided into clauses for
convenient reference. All of these points,
however, are of minor importance and
hardly detract from the general high scholarship
of the text.</p>

<p>There are many illustrations, maps and
diagrams which bear on the text. These
are of a general high order, but some improvements
might be made: Map, p. 58, of
the New England colonies should be larger;
also one on page 97 of the intercolonial
war. No map of the important 1609 Virginia
grant is given. Not enough as to
parallels and coast points is indicated on
the map of the Virginia, 1606, grant, p. 40.
On the map of the Louisiana purchase, p.
255, the Sabine River should be noted.
A map accompanying the description of
the early Virginia campaign (Civil War)
would be helpful. The map on page 400 is
not clear; it would be improved by designating
rivers and railroads differently.
Not all the necessary rivers on map, p. 406,
are named. Some of the maps are without
scale of miles, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i>, p. 403, p. 406, &amp;c.
All these points are non-essentials, yet they
are to be considered in the teaching of the
subject.</p>

<p>The bibliographical aids are of several
kinds. There are marginal references
throughout the narrative, bearing directly
upon it. At the close of each chapter there
are two classes of references, “topics,” and
“studies,” there being several (exact pages
given) to the former, and one to each of
the latter. There are from two to four
topics; and the number of studies averages
about ten. It will thus be seen that the
text is arranged in such a way that much
or little reference reading need be done, as
the varying conditions permit.</p>

<p>Suggestive library lists are given. However,
they would be more helpful to the
busy, “small school” teacher if publisher
and price were noted. There is a summary
at the close of each chapter; also questions,
which are not so much to test one’s memory
of the subject as to lead him to independent
thinking. The marginal analysis of
the text is always helpful. The appendix
includes Declaration of Independence, Constitution
of the United States, and tables of
President and Presidential elections, and
statistics of states. The book is substantially
bound and attractive from the bookmaker’s
standpoint. The index is very
full. The phraseology is clear and simple,
and the book is entirely adapted to any year
of the high school, or to more advanced
classes, in view of the extensive references.
Mr. Ashley has picked out the salient points
in American history. From the standpoint
of scholarship and pedagogical requirements,
this text will take high rank.</p>

<p class="authorheader">WILLIAM FAIRLEY, Ph.D., Editor.</p>

<p class="subtitleheader">A REVIEW.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Not a review of the work we teachers
have been doing with our friends,
the ancient Greeks; but a digression
which will be in some sort a review of a
notable book will occupy us for a little.
There has recently appeared The Lowell
Lectures for 1908-9 by Professor John P.
Mahaffy, of Trinity College, Dublin, on
“What Have the Greeks Done for Modern
Civilization.” The book is altogether helpful
to the lover of the Greek world. And
to him not only; but to the reader who
through early limitations of culture may
have but slight ideas of the importance of
the Greeks, a reading of this book should
be what to one brought up in the dim light
of a cave or in the dense shadows of some
vast forest would be a first glimpse of the
glorious orb of day, the source of all the
shaded light and all the warmth that had
hitherto been his to enjoy without suspicion
of the existence of the master light.
Professor Mahaffy’s gladsome task is to
impress the primacy of Greece in all our
best thinking and truest living. He is indeed
an enthusiast. Occasionally the judicious
reader will question some of the results
of his enthusiasm. But the author
is the Nestor of the Greek scholars of the
English-speaking world. He says of himself
at the close of his lectures: “So now,
when my part in the race is nearly run,
there remains to me no higher earthly satisfaction
than this, that I have carried
the torch of Greek fire alight through a
long life&mdash;no higher earthly hope than this,
that I may pass that torch to others, who
in their turn may keep it aflame with
greater brilliancy perhaps, but not with
more earnest devotion ‘in the Parliament
of men the Federation of the world.’” He
bitterly decries the modern displacement of
the study of the Greek tongue and the
knowledge of Greek life at first hand; but
at the same time serves as an interpreter
of what was best in Greece to those of us
who are not quite at home in this language
of queer type and involved syntax.</p>

<p>So in this close of our study of Greece
for the current school year, let me earnestly
recommend the perusal of this book to all
teachers of our department. We cannot
give a hundredth part of it to our pupils,
now, or in later courses; but it will serve
to imbue ourselves deeply with the Greek
spirit, and help us to enforce the true value
of our heritage from the Greeks, the master
minds of all our thinking. Some of us
will not have opportunity to read the book.
For them let me try to give a few glimpses
of its worth.</p>

<p>There are eight lectures: Introductory;
Greek Poetry; Greek Prose; Greek Art&mdash;I:
Poetry and Sculpture; II: Painting and
Music; Science; Grammar, Logic, Mathematics,
Medicine; Politics, Sociology, Law;
Higher Thinking, Philosophy, Speculative
and Practical Theology. The thesis of the
whole is that the best in life is wrought
out elaborately and with pains by men of
deep thought and long reflection. It is a
glorifying of the ideal as over against the
modern rush of practicality.</p>

<p>In his introductory lecture Professor
Mahaffy seeks not to account for the Greek
preëminence&mdash;that cannot be done; but to
assert it, as one might extol the sporadic
genius of a Mozart. He then shows how
the Romans and the men of medieval
Europe failed to grasp, as our modern
world since the Renaissance has been grasping,
the real meaning of Greece. And here
comes in his plea for the study of Greek.
He writes: “The danger I see before this
generation is that which came upon the
Roman world insensibly and which resulted
in a decadence not arrested till it sunk
into the night of the dark ages. The later
empire was content to take Greek art and
Greek letters at second hand, and to substitute
Latin culture for the models which
had educated their greatest masters. But ...
the copy had not the life of the
original. So we, too, with all our science,
with our increase of material knowledge
and our joyless running to and fro may
sink into an ugly, tame, joyless conglomeration
of societies, for whom new discoveries
supply hosts of new conveniences, but no
return to the happiness and contentment
of a simpler age.... Happiness does
not lie here, no, nor in motors, nor in turbines,
nor in wireless messages across the
globe, nor in daily newspapers full of inextricable
fact and falsehood.”</p>

<p>In the chapters devoted to literature with
wealth of argument and illustration is
pointed out our well-known debt for
rhythm and meter, period and cadence. In
specific cases: “There can be no question
that in the oratory of debate the Greeks
taught the Romans, then through them
mediæval Europe, then, after the Renaissance,
modern Europe directly, so that
even now they are the acknowledged masters
in this splendid art.” And: “The
laws of prose composition, as devised and
perfected by Isocrates, are the most subtle
and complete ever put into practice by any
living man.”</p>

<p>These supreme exemplars of prose and
verse, he declares, have no lesson for us
of unstudied eloquence and unpremeditated
art. Everything was polished to the pitch
of perfection with unremitting toil.</p>

<p>Architecture and sculpture reveal the
highest glories of Greek art. The refinements
of line by which optical delusion was
corrected in the Parthenon are pointed out
with admiration. Speaking of the frieze
of the same temple, he remarks: “There
is even this subtlety in the detail of the
work&mdash;that, as this band of figures was
intended to be seen high above the spectator,
care was taken to carve the lower
limbs in slightly flatter relief than the
upper, and the limbs of the horses were
even made a little lighter than in nature,
in order to counterbalance the predominance
which the part nearer to the spectator’s
vision might assume.” Glimpses of genius&mdash;pains
and skill&mdash;such as that are of high
artistic, yes, and moral value to our youth.
Attention is called to what so many of us
ignore, that color was freely used in both
building and sculpture. Our flat whites
would have been unbearable to these masters.
Their perfection in statuary is the
loving despair of the world to-day.</p>

<p>In the chapter on science are a host of
facts which are not unfamiliar to the
scholar, but which serve to hush some of
our modern boastfulness. Some things will
be new to many readers. Such are the
system of numerical notation, almost as
simple as our Arabic digits. The extent of
Greek mathematical investigation is better
known. Of great interest is the account of
Greek medicine, which got so far beyond
the nostrums, the philtres and superstitions
to which medieval quackery returned.</p>

<p>In politics is found the weak point of
Greece; yet even here we must use the
historical perspective. And thus, by contrast,
this ancient advance over Oriental
thraldoms and tyrannies is all the more
wonderful.</p>

<p>In matters of private law it is almost
startling to come across a will like this,
taken from a papyrus of Græcised Egypt:
“This is the will of Peisias the Lycian,
son of X., of sound mind and deliberate intention.
May it be my lot to live on in
health and manage mine own property, but
should anything human happen to me, I
bequeath to my children so much, to my
wife such and such things, I set free certain
slaves; I set apart money for religious
purposes. And I appoint as executors such
and such people.” A will like this would
be admitted to probate in any surrogate’s
court to-day.</p>

<p>The chapters on philosophy and theology
are necessarily deep, but of supreme importance.
For in them we are reminded of how
by pure thinking the Greeks anticipated the
best and latest of our modern thought. The
atomic theory, the unity of the universe, the
oneness of God, the eternal sanctions of the
right, the high behests of the moral law,
were all worked out over two thousand
years ago.</p>

<p>“If the time should ever come when
men will no longer be led by revelation,
when they will reject miracle and prophecy,
and determine to be led by the mere light
of reason ... there will still remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the ethical types which Zeno and Epicurus
have crystallized in their systems&mdash;there
will always remain the man of duty
and the man of pleasure, the man who
lives for others and he who lives for himself,
in terms of modern philosophic jargon, the
Altruist and the Egoist, the Spiritualist
and the Materialist.”</p>

<p>It were well for our youth and their
teachers to bow before a race who in that
dim and early age could think the thoughts
and set in motion the influences which are
most vital among us of the later time.</p>

<p>A formal presentation of the closing
scenes of purely Greek history is precluded
by the foregoing notice of Professor
Mahaffy’s work. It may suffice to point out
the three subjects most worthy of emphasis.
These may well be: 1, the failure of
the Greek federations before and after Alexander,
owing to jealousies; 2, the extent
and the political failure of the work of
Alexander, and 3, the Hellenizing of the

<p class="subtitleheader">THE RELIGIOUS WARS.</p>


<h3>Some General Considerations.</h3>

<p>The long period of struggle which followed
the reform movement of the sixteenth
century seems of comparatively little
importance beside the revolt itself; and yet
it offers possibilities of treatment which
the secondary teacher cannot well afford to
neglect. The modern tendency in text-book
writing has been to suppress the details
of wars in order to allow for a fuller
treatment of other phases of development.
Assuming that the teachers of the past
generation, and not a few of the present
day, have been laying too much emphasis
on details of this character, the pendulum
has seemed at times to swing too far in
the direction of elimination and condensation
in the treatment of great epoch making
wars. Many an opportunity has thereby
been neglected of inculcating great truths
which could more easily be exemplified by
stories drawn from the battlefield than from
less stirring episodes. Wars are often presented
in so cursory a fashion as to convey
little idea of their real character and
significance. They become little less than
dry summaries of causes and effects and
are stripped altogether of that personal
element which is so necessary to the attainment
of the best results in history
teaching. The possibility of utilizing these
struggles as a correlating element has
usually been farthest from the thought of
the teacher, or at best been but imperfectly
realized. The religious wars afford the
teacher not only the possibility of vivid
biographic treatment, but may serve to bind
the closer certain common lines of development
peculiar to the Europe of the latter
part of the sixteenth century and the first
half of the seventeenth century.</p>


<h3>Luther and the Beginnings of the Protestant
Revolt.</h3>

<p>There can be but very little choice of
method in the presentation of the facts connected
with the beginnings of the Protestant
revolt. Luther’s life must be taken
up in more or less detail and the attention
directed to the various influences with
which he came in contact. To secure a
proper understanding of the effects of his
teachings, the political as well as the religious
background of his endeavors must
be carefully sketched. Little difficulty will
probably be experienced in showing how the
Renaissance movement became intimately
associated with church reform as it passed
the barriers of the Alps and took hold of
the more serious-minded Germans. This
connection is much easier to establish from
the fact that the attention of the class has
already been drawn to the part taken by
Erasmus in the Renaissance proper. The
question will probably arise as to how far
the teacher should delve into the more distant
past to resurrect the various efforts at
reform which marked the earlier centuries.
Any opportunity for a résumé of this
character should be heartily welcomed, as
it serves better than any formal review to
test the grasp by the student of the facts
already covered. When the teacher is ready
to take up the revolt itself, there is apparently
but one logical method of securing
results, and that is to present Luther’s life
in as much detail as time will permit,
showing how he felt himself driven by the
force of his own logic into a position entirely
antagonistic to the Church as it was
then established. The parting of the ways
is reached with the great scene at Worms.
Contrary to his expectations, his protest
within the Church had made him not only
its avowed enemy, but the founder of a
new sect.</p>


<h3>Characteristics of Period from 1521 to 1648.</h3>

<p>It is a comparatively easy matter to dispose
of the remaining events in this drama
in which Luther, the Emperor and the Pope
are the main actors; but in what connection,
and in how much detail, shall the
teacher present the beginnings of the reform
movement in other countries, the
counter movement in the Catholic Church,
and the struggles which arose over questions
of religion in every land where Protestantism
secured a foothold? The fact
that sooner or later the struggle between
Catholics and Protestants resolved itself
into a civil war of considerable proportions
makes it possible to utilize these struggles
as the principal unifying element in the
treatment of the entire period from 1521
to 1648. This plan differs from the ordinary
arrangement of material to be found
in the text-book in that it places less stress
upon the beginnings of the reform movement
outside of Germany, subordinating
these details to the wars as the central
theme and directing the attention of the
student only to such events as help to explain
the character of these struggles. The
teacher must, however, bear in mind
throughout that “the story of no European
country or group of countries in this
troubled period admits of being told as
detached from the contemporary history of
its neighbors, allies, or adversaries.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Beyond emphasizing the fact that the revolt
spread to other lands, it is a question
whether the time is wisely spent in treating
in detail the Calvinistic movement emanating
from Geneva, or the beginnings of
Presbyterianism in Scotland, or the overthrow
of Catholicism in England. The one
central idea which the student should grasp
as a result of his study of the period&mdash;an
idea which is decidedly within the range
of his comprehension and appreciation&mdash;is
that religion, which had long been a dominant
factor in European politics, now lost
its power to sway the political destinies of
thrones and empires. In fact a new era
had dawned in which the Church found itself
removed from politics and the world
given over to interests of quite a different
character. This change may be illustrated
further along by the insignificant part
taken by the representatives of the Pope
in the deliberations concerning the Treaties
of Westphalia.</p>

<p>The growth of toleration should also be
noted as an important characteristic of this
new period. Finally the student’s attention
may with profit be directed to the general
tendency in these struggles toward the
subordination of the higher interests of religion
to selfish and dynastic interests.
Time and again religion serves merely as a
cloak for the concealment of ambitions of
the most secular character. The ideals of
true religion were perhaps never more perverted
from their true ends and made to
serve the basest and lowest uses.</p>


<h3>Outline of Plan of Presentation.</h3>

<p>After calling attention briefly to the fact
that this spirit of revolt manifested itself
in other countries, a logical plan of presentation
would be first to discuss the ineffectual
efforts of the Emperor Charles V and
Pope Leo X to check the movement as it
spread through Germany, with an explanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of their failures; then to describe the
more successful efforts in this direction
taken within the church itself and known
as the Counter Reformation; and finally to
introduce Philip II as the great champion
of orthodoxy, devoting his entire energies
and the resources of a great empire to the
superhuman task of restoring the church to
its former position of power and influence.
His career calls up Alva’s efforts to subdue
the Netherlands, and that heroic figure,
William the Silent; and the sailing of the
Great Armada.</p>

<p>One semi-religious war, if not two, have
already been under discussion in connection
with these efforts to suppress the revolt,
the Dutch War of Independence and the
Spanish Armada. Here is apparently the
proper place to introduce the other struggles,
beginning with the Thirty Years’ War
in Germany, then taking up in turn the
Huguenot wars in France and the Puritan
Revolution in England, and closing the
period with the sequel to this last struggle,
The Glorious Revolution of 1688.</p>


<h3>The Thirty Years’ War.</h3>

<p>It is natural to turn to Germany first in
presenting the religious wars because of the
greater familiarity of the student with conditions
there. The order becomes thereby
strictly chronological, as the Schmalkaldic
War broke out in 1546; or, in other words,
earlier by several years than either of the
other struggles. This war gave rise to the
Peace of Augsburg, which was a source of
so much discontent that it has been counted
as one of the great factors in bringing on
the main struggle. Among the points which
seem to call for special emphasis are the
mixture of religious and political causes
underlying the struggle, and the general
participation of many of the great powers
of Western Europe. This fact served to
prolong the war and to give it a more
European character and a wider significance.
It was not merely a question of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cujus regio,
ejus religio</i>, but of important dynastic and
territorial interests. The efforts directed
toward the overthrow of the power of the
Hapsburgs and the peculiar interests of
Denmark, Sweden and England in the contest
call for special emphasis. The power
of the Hapsburgs in the time of Charles V
and later can be shown to good advantage
by the use of outline maps. At least three
great personalities dominate the scene,
Wallenstein, Richelieu and Gustavus Adolphus,
all of whom furnish rich material for
biographical study. Although it is possible
to follow the campaigns with an atlas like
Putzger, this study is comparatively barren
of results except as it throws light upon
the military genius of a Wallenstein or on
the prowess of “The Lion of the North.”
The effects of the war were to be seen in
Germany in the weakness of the central
government and in the wretchedness and
misery consequent upon thirty years of
marching and countermarching on the part
of hostile armies. The picture sketched by
Gardiner in his Thirty Years’ War is well
nigh incredible. The territorial changes
which followed the war can best be shown
by the preparation of a map. They are
much more readily appreciated if they appear
by themselves. (See, for example, the
map in Harding, “Essentials,” p. 339, or
Wakeman “Ascendancy of France, 1598-1715,”
p. 124.)</p>


<h3>The French Wars of Religion.</h3>

<p>The treatment of the religious wars in
France will differ slightly from that of the
Thirty Years’ War, as it becomes necessary
in this connection to introduce a few facts
about Calvinism. This need not involve
much more than the briefest possible statement
of what Calvin taught, pointing out
how his teachings appealed to the intellect
and the understanding rather than to the
emotions, as did those of Luther. As a
result the Huguenots counted among their
numbers some of the best families of
France. The personal element can be made
very prominent in these struggles, as it was
largely the intrigues of two families, the
Guises and the Bourbons, aided and abetted
by the Queen Mother, Catherine de Medici,
which kept France embroiled for all these
years. Here, too, is to be noted the same
situation which prevailed in Germany,
namely, the apparent powerlessness of the
French people to solve their own religious
and dynastic troubles alone without the interference
of outside nations, notably England
and Spain. Selfish and dynastic interests
seem to have decidedly the upper hand
here as contrasted with Germany. Much
can be made of such dramatic episodes as
the massacre of St. Bartholomew and the
conversion of the Huguenot leader, Henry
of Navarre. The edict of Nantes and its
effect upon France should be contrasted
with the religious clauses in the Treaties of
Westphalia. The great problem which this
settlement raised of a state within a state,
made necessary the work of Richelieu, whose
career can now be rounded out by showing
how he was laboring for one and the same
end in his treatment of the Huguenots at
home and his support of the Protestants
abroad. French history is thus brought
down to the age of Louis XIV.</p>


<h3>The Puritan Revolution.</h3>

<p>The English struggle can be discussed
along much the same lines as the wars in
France and Germany. More time should perhaps
be given to pointing out the effects of
the Renaissance on England and the great
intellectual, economic, social, and religious
changes which had come to pass in the time
of the Tudors. Their reigns mark the great
period in English history. The dominant
characteristic of English development, the
growth of liberty, which had often placed
England in sharp contrast with the continent
was never more prominently displayed
than during the period under consideration.
The Great Civil War partakes of the twofold
character of the continental wars. It
marks on the one hand a struggle between
two religious sects; on the other a contest
between the king and the representatives of
the people. The prominence of this second
phase, the fact that it was a struggle
between two Protestant sects instead of
between Catholics and Protestants, and
that it took place so long after the general
upheaval following the break with Rome,
have served to isolate it more or less from
the struggles on the continent. The gains
for freedom, which were the final outcome of
this struggle, differentiate it from those in
France and Germany. Henry IV and Richelieu
prepared the way for the absolutism of
Louis XIV. In Germany the disorganization
and demoralization of the central government
placed the destinies of the German
people in the hands of rival princes, whose
political creed may be summed up in the
words of Frederick William I of Prussia,
“Salvation belongs to the Lord; everything
else is my business.” The rulers of England,
on the contrary, were forced to recognize
the power of parliament to control their
ministers, and more important still, to acknowledge
the sovereign people as the ultimate
source of their power and authority.
The admission of this principle of government
was not entirely the work of the Puritan
Revolution, but needed the additional
lesson of the tyranny and overthrow of
James II. Not the least important among
the benefits which the movement of 1688
conferred upon England was the general
recognition of the principle of toleration.</p>

<p>The opportunity which this method affords
the teacher of contrasting English
conditions with those on the continent
should lead to a better understanding and
appreciation of England’s relation to and
part in general European progress. Her internal
history furnishes another illustration
of the great characteristic of this period,
the passing of religious questions from the
sphere of politics and the appearance of
issues of an entirely different character.</p>


<h3>Bibliography.</h3>

<p>The text-book will probably be found to
furnish all the material needed for the
presentation of this period, with the possible
exception of details of a biographical
character. “The Heroes of the Nations”
series contains good biographies of Gustavus
Adolphus, by C. R. L. Fletcher; of
Henry IV, by P. F. Willert, and of Cromwell,
by Charles Firth. These may be supplemented
by the volumes in the “Foreign
Statesmen Series,” on Richelieu, by R.
Lodge; on William the Silent, by Frederic
Harrison, and on Philip II, by Martin
Hume. The volumes in the “Epochs of
Modern History Series,” which cover this
period, The Thirty Years’ War and the
Puritan Revolution, by S. R. Gardiner,
furnish considerable supplementary information
in a convenient and compact form.
The best atlases are probably Putzger, and
Gardiner (“Atlas of English History”).</p>

<p class="subtitleheader">THE ADMISSION OF MISSOURI.</p>

<p class="subtitleheader">A Type Lesson.</p>

<p>Happily our pupils nowadays are no
longer compelled to commit to memory
lists of the states admitted during each
administration. While we are all agreed
as to the futility of this antiquated practice
we must at the same time recognize
that no pupil should leave our schools without
a fairly definite idea of the process by
which new states are created. This knowledge
is essential to a comprehension of the
present condition of the nation and of its
development in the future. It is the purpose
of the present article to show how a
grasp of the process of admitting states
may be developed by means of the story
of the admission of some one typical state.</p>

<p>Vermont and Kentucky at once suggest
themselves because of the very early date
of their formation. To these states, however,
as to others admitted in the first
few administrations, there is the objection
that their admission was not typical of the
process. This is due to their previous dependence
upon or relation to some of the
original states. Missouri, on the other
hand, lying west of the Mississippi, may be
said to typify most of the states subsequently
admitted. Another reason for the
choice of Missouri lies in the fact that our
courses of study require us to present the
subject of the Missouri Compromise, thus
furnishing the best excuse in the world for
developing in that connection our type-lesson
on the admission of new states.</p>

<p>The first point that should be developed
is the relation between the national government
and the territory of the United
States. Only one definite reference to this
relation occurs in the federal constitution.
In Art. IV, section 3, we find this statement:
“The Congress shall have power to
dispose of and make all needful rules and
regulations respecting the territory or other
property belonging to the United States.”
We should impress our pupils with the
significance of this clause which places in
the hands of the national legislature complete
control over United States territory.
The wide extent of land which had come
into our possession by the Louisiana Purchase
could be disposed of by Congress in
any way that it might see fit. In this land
lay the future state of Missouri.</p>

<p>Having thus given due consideration to
the general relation between the United
States government and the territory which
it owns, we should pass next to the question
of the creation of new states. Our
pupils are presumably acquainted with the
necessity of referring to the Constitution
for any reference to a matter of fundamental
national law. It might be worth
while to have the children themselves find
the Constitutional provision which relates
to the admission of states. The first part
of Art. IV, section 3, provides that “new
states may be admitted by the Congress
into this Union,”&mdash;the rest of the clause,
as far as our present purpose is concerned,
may be dispensed with. Attention should
be called to the extreme indefiniteness of
this provision and to the general fact that
while the Constitution gives Congress full
control of United States territory and further
delegates to it the power to admit
new states, the actual mode of procedure
has been left to Congress itself to work out.</p>

<p>The ordinance of 1787 next calls for
reference and rapid review. For the purposes
of this lesson the ordinance is important
as having furnished the type of territory
destined to become an integral part of
our political organization. Further, it had
made definite provision for the future admission
of states to be carved out of the
Northwest territory. To be sure, this ordinance
was the work of the Continental Congress,
but it had been re-enacted by the
first Congress under the Constitution as
early as 1789. The process mapped out in
this famous ordinance had already furnished
the model for the creation of territories and
the admission of states in various parts of
the country.</p>

<p>The territory of Missouri, originally as
we have said a part of the Louisiana Purchase,
was organized by act of Congress
June 4, 1812. The class must be brought
to see the significance of this organization.
As a territory Missouri had definite boundaries
and an organized government. It
had a governor appointed by the President
of the United States, and a territorial legislature.
It of course had no voice in
national affairs, and was in last resort subject
to the will of Congress.</p>

<p>A flood of immigration from the eastern
states rapidly increased the population of
the new territory. It may be well, because
of the subsequent significance of the
fact, to point out that a large pro-slavery
element had made repeated unsuccessful
attempts to secure for slavery the states
which so far had been made from the
Northwest Territory. The anti-slavery provision
of the Northwest Ordinance, however,
continued to hold good, and slave
holders began to look across the Mississippi
for the extension of their dominion. So
rapid was the increase of population in Missouri
that in less than six years after its
organization as a territory we find it seeking
admission as a state. In the early
months of 1818 several memorials were presented
in the House petitioning for statehood,
and on April 3 of that year an enabling
act was introduced.</p>

<p>The discussion of the enabling act constitutes
one of the most important “type
elements” of our lesson. Normally the
passing of such an act by Congress must be
regarded as the first step in the transition
of a territory to a state. There are, to be
sure, some striking instances where states
have been admitted without the previous
passage of an enabling act by Congress&mdash;Texas
and California are cases in point&mdash;but
in our type lesson we are concerned with
the normal practice only. We must develop
in our pupils the idea of an enabling act as
the authorization of a territory by Congress
to adopt a state constitution and
present itself for admission into the Union
on equal terms with the other states; the
act further fixes the boundaries of the
prospective state.</p>

<p>As we have already mentioned, an enabling
act for the admission of Missouri
had been introduced into the House as early
as April 3, 1818. The passage of the final
Missouri Enabling Act, however, did not
take place until March 6, 1820. The fact
that this delay was caused by the bitter
fight over slavery extension must by all
means be emphasized, but the history of
the struggle in Congress,&mdash;of the amendments,
references, committee reports, etc.,
is far too complex to form a part of any
elementary lesson. It will be sufficient if
our pupils understand that there was a constant
struggle to preserve the balance of
slave and free states, and grasp the significance
of the admission of Alabama in 1819
and of the application of Maine in that
same year.</p>

<p>The Enabling Act of 1820, as typical of
enabling acts in general, should receive
careful attention. Section 1 authorizes the
people of the territory of Missouri “to
form for themselves a constitution and
state government, and to assume such
name as they shall deem proper.” Section
2 consists of an exact statement of the
boundaries of the new state. The phrasing
of these sections is significant, typical, and
interesting, and should be presented to the
class in full.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Section 7 states that the new constitution,
when drafted, shall be transmitted to
Congress. This provision for approval by
Federal authority is important and characteristic
of enabling acts in general, which regularly
require the applicant state to submit
its constitution for approval to the Federal
government, usually to Congress.</p>

<p>Section 8 of the Enabling Act embodies
the Missouri Compromise, and is of great
importance on that account. As far, however,
as the mere question of the admission
of new states is concerned, this section
cannot be considered pertinent. If the
teacher’s aim is to present the admission
of Missouri and the Missouri Compromise
as one general topic, full consideration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
this section must here be given. Otherwise
passing reference will suffice.</p>

<p>The people of Missouri acting under
authority of their enabling act, at once proceeded
to frame a state constitution. Beyond
the fact that state constitutions are
framed by conventions chosen by the people,
and are usually submitted to the people
themselves for ratification, the intimate
details of the process will serve rather to
confuse than to clarify the idea we are
seeking to develop. Suffice it to say that
a pro-slavery constitution was finally
adopted in July, 1820, and transmitted to
Congress later in that year.</p>

<p>Let me repeat at this point that it is of
the utmost importance in all our history
work that we shall emphasize essentials and
omit entirely the discussion of intricate
points which, while of some constitutional
importance, and frequently of great interest
to the mature student, can only work harm
if introduced into the work of the grades.
It is in accordance with this principle that
I would advocate reducing to a minimum
any discussion of the contest which occurred
in Congress over the question of the
Missouri constitution. The class should of
course understand that there was such a
contest, and that Henry Clay did more than
any other one man to bring it to an amicable
conclusion. On March 2, 1821, the
resolution to admit Missouri as a state was
approved, and on August 10th a proclamation
announced the addition of another star
to the flag.</p>

<h3>THE HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION
(ENGLISH).<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></h3>

<p>English teachers of history organized an
association about three years ago, in May,
1906. At a preliminary meeting held at
University College, London, it was resolved
to form an Historical Association.
On June 30th of the same year a constitution
and by-laws were adopted and officers
of the Association were elected. All persons
are eligible for membership who are
engaged or interested in the teaching of history.
The annual subscription to the Association
is five shillings, payable on July
1st. The president is Professor C. H. Firth,
Oxford. The treasurer is J. E. Morris, and
the secretary Miss M. B. Curran, 6 South
Square, Gray’s Inn, London, W. C. There
are 15 vice-presidents, including men and
women connected with college and school
life of the kingdom, many of whom are
well-known in America. In addition to
these officers there is a council of 29 persons.
The association has established a number
of local branches which in March, 1909,
numbered 13. The activities of the Association
are the holding of annual meetings,
the encouragement of local centers and the
study of local history, and the publication
of a series of leaflets. Up to June, 1909,
these leaflets numbered 17. The topics
treated are as follows:</p>

<p>No. 1. Source-books.</p>

<p>No. 2. Some Books on the Teaching of
History in Schools.</p>

<p>No. 3. A Summary of Historical Examinations,

<h3>NEW YORK CITY CONFERENCE.</h3>

<p>The New York Conference of History
Teachers held its meeting on Saturday, December
11, 1909, at the College of the
City of New York. After the opening address,
Professor Henry Johnson, of Teachers’
College of Columbia University, gave
the principal paper upon “Special Aids to
Visualization in the Teaching of History.”
This was followed by a discussion upon
“The Solution of Some Practical Difficulties.”
Miss Francis E. Chapman, of the
Flushing High School, spoke upon “Lack
of Judgment”; Miss Clara Byrnes, of the
Normal College, on the “Lack of Vocabulary”;
Miss Edith M. Tufts, of the Speyer
School, upon the “Failure to Understand
Alien Morals,” and Mr. James G. Croswell,
of the Brearley School, upon “Lack of
Imagination.” At the close of the meeting
a luncheon was held in a neighboring hotel.</p>

<p>The report of the committee on nomination
for officers for 1909-10 was adopted as
follows: For chairman, Livingston Rowe
Schuyler; secretary, Daniel C. Knowlton;
treasurer, W. Franklin Brush. For members
of the executive committee: Miss Clara
Byrnes, Arthur P. Butler, William Fairley,
James G. Croswell.</p>

<p>This New York Conference was organized
in response to an unanimous vote of the
third annual convention of the Association
of History Teachers of the Middle States
and Maryland, which authorized the formation
of local conferences of history teachers.
The announcement of the conference
meeting states that “The primary purpose
of the conference is the same as that of
the association&mdash;‘to advance the study and
teaching of history and government through
discussion,’ and ‘to promote personal acquaintance
among teachers and students of
history.’ In these meetings a large number
of teachers can be reached whose duties and
location prevent them from attending conventions
at a distance. Such conferences
also afford opportunities for wider discussion
than is possible at the meetings of the
association. Free statement of opinion indicates
lines of work of great worth and
interest. The constitution and organization
are of the simplest type, and the fee a nominal
one of one dollar a year.”</p>


<h3>MISSOURI SOCIETY.</h3>

<p>The Missouri Society of Teachers of History
and Government will meet on December
28th and 29th in the Central High
School Building, St. Louis. The following
program has been arranged:</p>

<p class="center">TUESDAY AFTERNOON, DECEMBER 28TH.</p>

St. Louis.</p>

<p>“What Topics in Ancient and Mediæval
History Need Special Emphasis to Prepare
the Pupil for the Modern Period?” Miss
Ellen B. Atwater, Central High School, St.
Louis. Discussion.</p>

<p>“Recent Books,” Professor N. M. Trenholme,
Columbia.</p>

<p class="center">WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON, DECEMBER 29TH.</p>

<p>1.45&mdash;History in the Grades: “Geographic

<h3>A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF HISTORY FOR
SCHOOLS.</h3>

<p>The bibliography of history for schools
which was published serially last year in
the “Atlantic Educational Quarterly,” is
about to be issued in more elaborate form
by Longmans, Green &amp; Co. The work
seems to meet a need among teachers who
find it difficult to keep abreast of available
historical literature in English, and who are
often in doubt as to the relative merits of
various standard works. The bibliography,
as enlarged and revised, will contain selected
lists of the most approved historical
works in English, covering the whole field
of history, with separate sections devoted
to historical reading for children. The
portions relating to American history will
be worked out with unusual fullness and
care. Works on aids to history, method,
universal history, biography, ecclesiastical,
constitutional and economic history will
also be included, and a specially prepared
list of books on American government will
be given. Every work mentioned whether
in one volume or many volumes, will be
carefully annotated in a criticism of from
two to twenty lines, and in the case of
larger works at even greater length. Each
entry will contain the name of the author,
the title of the work in full, year of publication,
price and name of the publisher.
The bibliography has been prepared by a
committee of the Maryland History Teachers’
Association, consisting of Professor
Charles M. Andrews, of the Johns Hopkins
University; Mr. J. Montgomery Gambrill,
head of the department of history and
civics of the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute,
and Miss Lida Lee Tall, supervisor of
grammar grades, Baltimore county, Maryland.
It will be issued under the auspices
of the Association of History Teachers of
the Middle States and Maryland.</p>

<h3>USE OF SOURCES.</h3>

<p class="ir1">Saint Louis, Nov. 29, 1909.</p>

<p>Editor <span class="smcap">History Teacher’s Magazine</span>:</p>

<p>Kindly permit me to write a word in regard
to Professor Fay’s criticism of Professor
Fling’s article in the September
number of your excellent magazine.</p>

<p>Professor Fling some years ago blazed the
trail for a reform in history instruction
throughout the country. Like every pedagogical
reformer, he advanced a theory
which many&mdash;perhaps, only few&mdash;were willing
to carry out in its entirety. But what
man who is a reformer does have his whole
scheme adopted? Professor Fling did certainly
arouse history teachers from their
lethargy and from the “one-book” method
of teaching; at least, he contributed in no
small part to this result.</p>

<p>I can find nothing in Professor Fling’s
article at variance with modern educational
thought. It does not argue, I take it, that
we shall make trained historical scholars
out of our high school pupils; but it does
argue&mdash;and rightly so, it seems to me&mdash;that
we give them a glimpse of the material
out of which history is written. What
better way to get them to practice the critical
attitude towards the printed page?
Professor Fay says that the sources should
not be in the hands of the pupils, “being
unsuited to their mental capacity.” I have
used them with first year and with fourth
year pupils, and in all periods of history.
The use of them requires more work by the
teacher. They should generally be accompanied
by questions or topics; or they can
profitably be made a source of class study.
What an excellent opportunity of teaching
the pupils how to study,&mdash;a thing in which
but few high school students are entirely
proficient.</p>

<p>I will admit that I am not prepared to
go the extent that Professor Fling advocates,
and apply “internal” and “external”
criticism to references twice a week.
But because we cannot endorse his method
entirely, should we reject it entirely? There
are many ideas which he advances in the
“Salamis” study which can easily be followed
in many other periods. The use of
sources will be very imperfectly handled in
the hands of an unskilled teacher, but that
is no criticism on the use of them. What
better reference for 1789 in France than the
source, Arthur Young’s “Travels.” In
using such an attractive work, must we not
raise the very questions which Professor
Fling suggests in the “Salamis” study?
A study of one page of the expense account
of the South Carolina Legislature
during reconstruction days will mean more
than a whole chapter of secondary authority
on reconstruction expenses. By the
way, could civics be taught without the
sources? History instruction is to furnish
information; but it is also to develop
discriminating judgment. In the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the sources&mdash;to what extent, will depend on
the teacher,&mdash;these results will be attained,
and the subject vitalized, more than in
any other way.</p>

<p>The fact that we cannot afford two recitations
a week when only four are given to
history is no argument against the method.
Professor Fling’s statements as to allotment
of time were made with reference to five
hours a week for history. And, anyway,
it is immaterial whether we can follow
Professor Fling’s method according to the
letter; we certainly, in our high school instruction,
need to follow the spirit of his
method. In fact, from one paragraph of
Professor Fay’s article, where he says he
would arouse the pupils’ interest “in
scenes and countries removed by time and
space from themselves,” it would seem that
he would use the source. The difference is
one of degree, not of kind; one of how to
use them, not whether to use them or no.</p>

<h3>SCHOOL LIBRARIES.</h3>

<p>Editor <span class="smcap">History Teacher’s Magazine</span>:</p>

<p>The question raised by Mr. Parham,
Librarian of the Little Rock High School
in the November number, concerning the
supply of reference books in history, is a
very vital one. I should like to make one
or two remarks by way of relating some
things concerning the making of the library
in the State Normal School with which I
am connected.</p>

<p>Our library has been created practically
within the last six years. Prior to that
time it consisted of a few hundred volumes,
indifferently selected and poorly adapted to
class-room needs. From the beginning of its
reorganization every instructor who has had
anything to do with the ordering of books
has sought first to purchase duplicate copies
of those books which his classes will
use in their class work from day to day.
The aim has been to make it possible for
every member of the class to read the
same references, hence duplicates ranging
from three to twenty have been purchased.
The general plan has been to have one copy
for about every three members in the class.
As a result we have numerous duplicates of
those titles that are used as references for
general class work. Of course these books
will wear out pretty rapidly&mdash;some are
already well worn out&mdash;and in a short time
they will all have to be replaced. But this
will give us an opportunity to put other
books that have been more recently written
in their place, and thus keep abreast of
the times.</p>

<p>But all our purchases have not been made
in this manner. We have been ordering
many other books in single copies which
are used chiefly for theme or thesis work,
though there are occasions when an entire
class will be sent to several different books
for a given subject.</p>

<p>So successful has this plan of buying duplicate
copies in large numbers been, that
we are constantly advising those who consult
us to do the same thing. Just the
other day a High School teacher wrote me
she had $35 to spend for library books on
Ancient History for a class of 70. I immediately
wrote her, recommending that she
put practically all of that precious $35 in
just two titles, Tucker’s “Life of the
Ancient Greeks” and Johnstone’s “Private
Life of the Romans.” I estimated that she
could get about ten copies of each of these
titles, and perhaps have enough left to buy
Oman’s or Bury’s “History of Greece,” and
How and Leigh’s or Pelham’s “History of
Rome.” I am sure that the results she will
get from this scheme will be far more satisfactory
than they would be if she spent
all of her money for single copies of a
great many more titles.</p>

<p>There may be objections to giving the
same assignment of reading to the entire
class, but I have found in my own work
here that the students in the history courses
of high school rank and those also of college
rank do better work and get better
results if they are, most of the time, given
identically the same assignments of reading.
I believe most firmly in the definite assignment
of pages in a book for the day-after-day
work. The student may be left to
his own devices in some instances, but not
in many. And the only way to make this
plan work is to buy numerous duplicate
titles of at least a few books, and to keep
this up until all the books for general class
work have been purchased. When that is
done, then attention can be given to stocking
up the library with those books that
will be needed in single copies only.</p>

<p>If there is anything fundamentally wrong
with this method of doing things I should
like to have it pointed out. So far it has
been the way of salvation to us here and to
many others around us.</p>

<h3>Editor <span class="smcap">History Teacher’s Magazine</span>.</h3>

<p>We have recently placed in our history
and other classes a series of Underwood and
Underwood stereographs. Will you kindly
publish in <span class="smcap">The History Teacher’s Magazine</span>
some suggestions as to how they may
be used with profit? Among others we
have placed one of the complete Italian
tours. We shall have about 60 in Roman
history next semester. Any suggestions
you may see fit to publish will be highly
appreciated.</p>

<p>I cannot stop without telling you how
much I enjoy the <span class="smcap">Magazine</span>. It grows better
each month. The suggestions are very
helpful. I have worked a number of them
out, and find them exceedingly practical.
It is always with considerable pleasure that
I look forward to the delivery of the <span class="smcap">Magazine</span>.
It is a timely publication, and will
do much for the history teaching throughout
the nation.</p>

<p class="ir1">C. R. G.</p>

<p>Have our readers any suggestions to offer
for such work?</p>


<h3>PACIFIC COAST BRANCH.</h3>

<p>The Pacific Coast Branch of the American
Historical Association held its annual meeting
at Stanford University, November
19-20. The afternoon session of Saturday,
the 20th, was devoted to History in the Secondary
Schools, the topic being “Ancient
History in the First Year of the High
School.” A very practical paper was read
by W. C. Westergaard, of the Alameda
High School, on the subject, “Points of
Contact between Ancient History and the
Present.”</p>

<p>The discussion that followed brought out
several points. Ancient History has been
the object of attack by several critics of
the high schools, and if it is to retain its
place it must justify itself. It is the weak
point in our secondary history work, chiefly
for two reasons: 1. It is the most remote
of the four “fields,” and yet is put before
beginners, whose mental power is undeveloped.
2. It is usually placed in charge of
less experienced teachers than are the other
courses. The method set forth in the essay
is well calculated to overcome the first of
these conditions. Children enjoy discussing
historical “problems” of a simple sort:
e. g., the conduct of the Romans after Caudine
Forks; the wisdom of Cæsar’s clemency.
Anything that will make the men of
the past real is useful; value of letters
(Pliny’s, etc.).</p>

<p>After the discussion was closed, the election
of officers resulted in the choice of
Professor E. D. Adams, Stanford University,
president; Prof. J. N. Bowman, University
of California, secretary-treasurer.</p>

should constitute a work that would be at once the most <b>useful</b> and <b>useable</b>, as
well as the most <b>complete</b> and <b>authoritative</b> reference library possible to make
in a single publication. Covering as it does <b>completely</b> the large field occupied
by all other Encyclopedias, it introduces many new features not found in
<b>any</b> other.</p>

<div class="smallfont">

<p>It is the only encyclopedia issued in convenient-sized volumes. Ninety per cent. of the encyclopedias in the homes to-day
are rarely used; the great weight and cumbersome size of the volumes are responsible for their lack of use.</p>

<p>“<em>Although possessing three other encyclopedias of great Merit</em>, <span class="smcap">The Imperial</span> <em>is referred to oftener than any other.
To me it is a necessity.</em>”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rev. John Miller</span>, Roselle, N. J.</p>

<p>It is the only one that includes all dictionary words, with their definitions, pronunciations, derivations, and synonyms,
all under a single alphabetical arrangement. It pronounces every title, <b>historical</b>, <b>biographical</b>, <b>geographical</b>, and
<b>scientific</b>. It is the only <b>pronouncing</b> encyclopedia.</p>

<p>“<em>I possess five others, but it is to</em> <span class="smcap">The Imperial</span> <em>that I refer oftener than to all the rest</em>.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">I. T. Cotton</span>, M. D.,
Charleston, W. Va.</p>

<p>It covers a <b>wider range</b> of topics by hundreds than does the largest of all other encyclopedias. It has had the most careful
editorial supervision. Incomparable for information about any <b>word</b>, <b>thing</b>, <b>person</b>, <b>place</b>, or <b>event</b>.</p>

<p>“<em>Meets more fully my idea of a perfect encyclopedia than any other.</em>”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ferris S. Fitch</span>, Ex-Supt. Public Instruction,
Michigan.</p>

<p><b>Up to date.</b> Having but recently been completed, it contains much information not found elsewhere.</p>

<p>“<em>In all respects answers my expectations&mdash;comprehensive, accurate and compact.</em>”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Professor Day</span>,
of Yale.</p>

<p>These features belong to <span class="smcap">The Imperial</span> <b>exclusively</b>; they distinguish it from all others; they mark it as
an exceptional production.</p>

<p>We propose to send this magnificent New Reference Library entirely at our own expense

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
